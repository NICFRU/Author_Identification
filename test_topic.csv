Technology,from Francine Prose's novel 'The Lives of the Muses' : 'Perhaps psychology has convinced us that the human psyche is too complex to derive something so tough and enduring as art from something so fragile and transitory as love nearly anything geography ambition expensive tastes an abusive childhood poverty seems a more probable motivation for making art than the promptings of longing or love.'

Internet,Up and down Brittan today and all over Europe over the next few days millions of people are going to be voting in the European elections.
Internet,I went to my first 'moot' today (a moot is just a cool pagan way of describing a gathering of people).
Internet,'First they came for the Communists but I was not a Communist so I said nothing.
Internet,I just wanted to post a quick message saying sorry for all the boring blogs I've been posting... all these posts about our crap internet connection computer game law suits and other technical and boring crap.
Internet,Well this has not actually solved any our current NTL internet problems but after our internet connection dropping again earlier today I've phoned NTL to report it and for the first time they have admitted that our router could not have been at fault.
Internet,For anyone that's interested I was meant to be going camping in Dover this weekend.
Internet,To try and cut a long story short NTL cable broadband is the worst connection to the internet I've ever had my old dial-up modem used to be more reliable.
Internet,By now most of you should have heard of the sad case of 14 year old Stefan Pakeerah who was stabbed to death by his friend 17 year old friend Warren Leblanc.
Internet,I'm currently typing this message into blog using my laptop but publishing it via my old desktop.
Internet,Although I officially finished working on the Rail Gourmet project on Friday I've spent the last few days adding some finishing touches to the site to make it perfect.

Internet,I hate it when this happens I'm so bad at falling asleep.
Internet,For any of you that know me well you will know that for the past few (I say few must be close to a year by now) months I've been waiting to get some freelance web development work that has been promised from my dad's company.
Internet,After close to two months of sloppy service abuse & neglect and an internet connection more unstable than a bull in a china shop my mum has finally become so pissed off with NTL she's given them the old heave-ho (Or in plain English we've cancelled our NTL broadband internet connection).
Internet,I've decided to leave the 'Gay_Pagans_UK' Yahoo group that I was a member of.
Internet,My good friend Caroline and I had a very nice trip to Rochester today.
Arts,I have an idea...this may sound crazy...but...why don't we start with one topic instead of everything Yeah Wrap your head around that one...
Arts,how about homosexuality....women in leadership...lords supper......hymns or choruses....announcements before or after the worship service....can a christian cuss......can a christian listen to secular music....should a church teach only its doctrine....does satan exist....are we predestined.....is the scripture perfect....are the gospels accurate....did jesus really raise from the dead....what about the jews.....what should we do with leviticus....where did abraham and moses go when they died.....what makes a person saved....are their modern day prophets....should speaking in tongues still be used by the church....which is more important....music or preaching or communion....why is there so much paul in the bible and so little peter and james....what should constitute church membership...how are we supposed to witness to others......how are we to explain that jesus is the only way.....should there be televangelists.....is there an absolute truth......is the god of the koran...the same as the god of the bible.....why did judas betray jesus.....was he controlled by satan.....why were their giants in the promised land....the scriptures say that angles mated with human women...i don't buy it..... well...thats enough for right now... Ryan
Arts,Let's cover a lot of these issues.
Arts,Guilt I only feel guilt when I sin.
Arts,on another issue all together....guilt...what about guilt....what place does it play in my life....should all christians feel guilty after watching the passion....or after going to church on sunday morning....or just reading the bible.....is there such a thing as too much guilt....maybe.....maybe not.....I know that for a long time I had a lot of guilt about a lot of stuff and I prayed for God to help me with my problems...but it didn't seem like it helpled all too much...so is God not powerful enough to help me...or am I too weak to help myself....or a combination of both....I don't think guilt should lead to a loss of faith....thats a bad deal.... Of course we should feel guilty about watching our savior be crucified.
Arts,so...it seems that I am the minority on this one....hmm...didn't expect that to happen at all....I always assumed that those i taught when take on my viewpoints...not saying that its a bad thing...actually i am quite happy that there is disagreement here...makes things much more interesting and it challenges me in my faith...we have to be challenged more...i think that christians try too hard sometimes to try and be nice....'thats whats wrong with you people....you just walk out when things get tough....you don't stay and fight....'....well let me tell you....I will stay and fight... on another issue all together....guilt...what about guilt....what place does it play in my life....should all christians feel guilty after watching the passion....or after going to church on sunday morning....or just reading the bible.....is there such a thing as too much guilt....maybe.....maybe not.....I know that for a long time I had a lot of guilt about a lot of stuff and I prayed for God to help me with my problems...but it didn't seem like it helpled all too much...so is God not powerful enough to help me...or am I too weak to help myself....or a combination of both....I don't think guilt should lead to a loss of faith....thats a bad deal....
Arts,I'd think that masturbating is a better alternative than to be sexually impure with another person.
Arts,Lusting is way too hard not to do.
Arts,I wish I had sexy problems.
Arts,So yesterday we had to give this presentation about the Christian subculture and how it has handled the topic of sexuality...for some odd reason we got talking about masturbation...and I ....being the strong minded person that I am....and willing to stir the pot a little...said that I don't think its that bigga deal....as long as it doesn't dominate ones life....of course....i was not met with much enthusiasm....many were offended about what i had to say...it felt like they were going to lynch me.....but....i don't think its a very black and white issue....sure there is lusting involved...and that has to somehow fall under the category of sexual immorality...well maybe not....be i am going to assume...but is it better for a teenage boy to sit in class and look at pretty girls and not think about the subject.....or is it better for him to masturbate....get that out of his mind and move on.....then maybe he can think clearly about God and his faith.....it just seems more beneficial in the long run...i am prolly wrong here....someone enlighten me.... Ryan
Arts,I just read the last chapter of Messy Spirituality again.
Arts,I know....sometimes I wonder just why we are equipped for doing some much harm...I guess it makes it that much harder to be holy...sometimes i wonder if we can really attain holiness....not just for a minute or two...but for entire days....like going without sinning for a couple weeks or something.....i hope that its true....because if there isn't a possibility of true holiness then i am sunk....and we are sunk as humans...I am not willing to believe that I cannot be perfect somehow....i guess cause thats i am always a humanist....i have been given enough ability to seek after God....if that ability disappears i think that we are no longer human.....sin is tough.....i haven't found a way to beat it yet....seek ye first the kingdom of God....and all things we will be added unto you......i can't help but think of the prayer that a man says after Jesus healed him 'Lord I believe.....help my unbelief....'......thats all I can hope for Ryan
Arts,God come back here I feel that I am too far away from God to get back.
Arts,And so we pray easy prayers and mistake them for mature prayers - “God if it’s your will please heal so and so.
Arts,We all have friends who we think aren't going on the right path...
Arts,I think that this is going to be a great thing for the youth group.
Arts,I always find it interesting how in my own life I can be perfectly happy with how my life is going only to have some random event shake me to the core.
Arts,I am beginning to understand that faith is not the way around pain it is the way through pain.
Arts,Hey guys...now I feel all special that I have been included in this great inner circle that y'all have been apart of lately.
Arts,I think it's very important to remember that it is one of many sins.
Internet,OK it worked... better than I thought it would too... /me munches on a hat...
Internet,If this works I'll eat my hat

Law,I was up and at'em this morning and would have been an hour early for work(think it might have had something to do with the endorphins released by chatting to Mr. Sunday Mr Thursday-Night Mr Next-Monday and Mr Weekend-Later-in-the-Month simultaneously last night - good job I'd stayed on the bottled water wouldn't have wanted to get those messages mixed up) but I decided to use the extra time to make an 8-mile half hour detour to the car hire place to pick up the gym bag and other stuff that I'd left in the Astra boot.

Publishing,Ah a really busy day at work today.
Publishing,All sorts of shifts and changes in the Assistant world lately - me and Vic have been away and moved house Pete has (currently) about 10 minutes left of his job before he moves to pastures new (well just down the road) Anne-Sophie came back from Luxembourg then darted off to Egypt for a holiday and is coming back this weekend before (gasp) moving house next week.
Publishing,We had a fun rehearsal on Saturday; Pete was in Oxford and though it's never as good when one of us can't make it it usually gives us an opportunity to spin off in a different direction.
Publishing,sporadic pos(t)er though I am a couple of blogs have caught my eye recently.
Publishing,Thursday's gig at the Pavilion Tavern went well.
Publishing,Okay so I've just re-designed the site added some links (mostly to brighton blogs or bands) and added the whizzy comments box you should see below.
Publishing,Back to the gig briefly... On after us the Strings didn't do much for me; it was very professional piano-led rock somewhere between Steely Dan and Starsailor without the former's wit or the latter's yawning earnestness.
Publishing,Saturday night's gig was our best so far by a long way.
Publishing,ooh - this is my new toy by the way....
Publishing,Look here I've had 150 hits today from people looking up piranhas.
Publishing,An excellent article from Sunday's Observer Music Monthly.

Publishing,For those of us who are completely caught up in Erwin James's Prison Diaries in the Guardian today's entry comes as a warm and pleasant surprise.
Publishing,A couple of months ago I spent about an hour trawling the web in vain for information about Pamela Hansford Johnson the out-of-print author of three of my favourite books (if not my three favourite books) - The Humbler Creation The Holiday Friend and An Error of Judgement.
Publishing,With Chris moving to Australia yesterday I thought a bit of topical news wouldn't go amiss.

Biotech,You may notice that I said that I emailed Abe at 15.36 hours but the post I posted said I posted it at 3.33 PM.
Biotech,in our campaign to physically force Abe to become blog-gy.
Biotech,Because I'm not going to tell you.
Biotech,Of course you do don't be silly.

Biotech,Does someone want to find Abe and tell him exactly what to do to become part of this lovely blog And I don't know give him step-by-step help along the way Like the Twelve Step program except possibly more/fewer steps and not for anonymus alchoholics.
Biotech,I have to go to Shooting Stars because 2/3 of my sisters are in it.
Biotech,Does Abe need an electronics tutorial (edit: Does Abe have the list -ursula) I like blogging at school.
Biotech,I had a thought which was we could be named TABASCO Talking About Books And Similar Clever Objectives.
Biotech,Abe's alive Having problems though so we'll have to sort this all out...

InvestmentBanking,Everyone gathers for the never planned always varied Sunset Celebration on the Mallory Dock.
InvestmentBanking,s: squirrel s: black one b : lol s: we've got a HUGE population of black squirrels in this town s: it's almost 1/2 s: my grandpa used to think it was amazing and so special every time he saw one.
InvestmentBanking,honking rest of songs type a positive b negative EVERYTHING
InvestmentBanking,'you vsny fo iy riyhrt' gives me shivers still.
InvestmentBanking,all of a sudden i've got this intense feeling that i could never ever be good enough for someone this perfect and a secret sort of feeling that at least i tricked him enough so that i'll get to see him if nothing else at least i'll have that little time to see him and feel him and look at him before he realizes what i really am .
InvestmentBanking,that smell - it's like instant tears but happy.
InvestmentBanking,i'm going through pictures that make me want to cry.
InvestmentBanking,This is a work in progress.. check back for links as i update it.
InvestmentBanking,i can't believe you were still making sense of me all drunk like that.
InvestmentBanking,it's the little stuff that really blows me away the stuff that you start out assuming that everyone will do because it seems so basic and then later on you just give up.. that stuff that you do that i always wanted and gave up on getting those are the things that make my head spin and make me love you so much.
InvestmentBanking,i've got no deeds to do no promises to keep i'm dappled and drowsey and ready to sleep let the morning-time drop all it's petals on me.
InvestmentBanking,i really am very much (terribly much) in love.
InvestmentBanking,backround noises The Store program and why it doesn't freak me out so much anymore.
InvestmentBanking,there is an element of good surprise that i've always needed yearned for.

InvestmentBanking,babies and when i decided it might be ok. more about brian - don't ever be jealous i love in him what i love in you too.
InvestmentBanking,some people i've noticed are not people (regardless of how wonderful they are and how much you love them) that you could ever be with.
InvestmentBanking,have you ever gotten that panic the kind when you change something on your blog and all of a sudden can't remember what the thing before that was i'm stopping that right now.
InvestmentBanking,mine from my brainstorming this afternoon.
InvestmentBanking,we were having a discussion wherein i said something about everyone around us going in a certain direction and how i felt vaguely upset about following them - told her i felt like i was in an after school special (you know the one where they lecture everyone by saying 'If everybody else jumped off a cliff...').. but only because we were going in that direction specifically because we figured that it must lead somewhere everyone else was going that way.. so i got about to the point in my explanation of the disquiet feeling i was having where i said 'If everybody else jumped off a cliff..' and lisa said 'I always hated that.
Museums-Libraries,I did have a little whiplash from an unexpected trip down memory lane recently.
Museums-Libraries,I find that a great part of the information I have was acquired by looking something up and finding something else on the way.
Museums-Libraries,Is anyone else freaked out the first time they try this Using blogger.com puts you right out there much quicker than I expected.
Museums-Libraries,I have thought about what I want this blog to be about some topic besides just me to give it coherence and trajectory.
Museums-Libraries,some of the people in my house are driving me crazy.
Museums-Libraries,due to the combination of the stalker thing and the no-sleep thing i am ridiculously outrageously paranoid today.
Museums-Libraries,so i've spent all morning and much of the afternoon calling lawyers.
Museums-Libraries,seen on a tee-shirt at work yesterday: 'this shirt is designed to distract girls while i stare at their chest.'
Museums-Libraries,just wanted to let everyone out there know that i am ok. life as usual has kept on keepin' on.
Museums-Libraries,or more correctly i have been being stalked (talk about awkward constructions) for the past two years.
Museums-Libraries,so for like the past couple of weeks i have been able to accomplish nothing.
Museums-Libraries,baths constant air conditioning riding everywhere in cars someone else cooking for me all the time an oven windows a dryer no flies in the kitchen swimming
Museums-Libraries,i think i've figured out why i was so upset yesterday (and most of today) about breaking up with manstick.
Museums-Libraries,so i went ahead and changed styles.
