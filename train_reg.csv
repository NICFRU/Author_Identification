24,So I was sitting on the john the other day and it was all rocking back and forth.
24,So I found this site in a gay magazine.
24,A lot of people believe that an employer’s decision on hiring a candidate depends on just skills and experience.
24,Emailing may seem simple but there are some complications that you need to be aware of otherwise your email may never be read by an employer.
24,There are over 6 Billion people on earth and to no surprise there aren’t 6 billion jobs to equal the score.
24,The person who always gets a good job is relentless and persistent in getting the job.
24,I think it’s about time that you tap into the mind of employer to explore their needs and wants.
24,How Reading Employers’ Chromosomes Will Get You Riches I think it’s about time that you tap into the mind of employer to explore their needs and wants.
24,12th August After a long thought about what to post in my second blog I am still clueless and my imagination seems to abscond when I need it the most.
24,‘The Da Vinci Code’ by Dan Brown is one book that has taken world by storm.
35,the top spot for me was las vegas.
35,ooooh questionnaires are fun where is it I wanna do it I wanna do it
35,i did a questionnaire online that would tell me based upon my responses where i would like to live.
35,What's in Oregon that tickles your fancy Pacific Northwest is like SO '94.
35,i'm going to move to oregon - anybody want to come with me
35,i agree with jimi and whoever doesn't is a fool.
35,Okay ironic circlists you heard Ben Let's vote All in favor of having the blogs post in sequential order from top to bottom (instead of bottom to top) so that it's easier to read say 'Aye' (make sure you post it on the blog as well instead of just saying it...).
35,jimi: like you i prefer sequential order as well; however since the page loads from the top it makes more sense to have all the messages in reverse chronological order to save you having to scroll all the way to the bottom.
35,are you jennifer asking that the circle have another anniversary party in november well sure just tell us when you'll be here and we can have a second dinner party
35,I just print my own money.
35,I am sadly unable to attend the Circle blogathering.
35,ben how about getting the blogs to post from top to bottom is that possible that way they can be read in sequential order instead of bottom to top...
35,thanks to some tips from allen i've been able to reduce the screen size for the word wrap on the blog - ideally this will allow everyone to read the blog without having to scroll horizontally.
35,There definitely are but it's a question of 'filling in the gaps.'
35,transcriptions are very tedious work - that's got to be a better way to make money.
35,As a test run for a potential gig I just spent the past 3 and a half hours transcribing a 37 min conference call.
35,Well my kidney infection is gone.
35,Will there be cuisine for us carnivores at the Panda Garden JK Can't say I watch television much at all anymore since about four years ago.
35,i don't really watch TV much anymore (maybe an hour or so a week) but when i do i watch Enterprise (the latest Star Trek) Junkyard Wars The Daily Show BattleBots... also pretty much anything having to do with science technology or otherwise geekworthy topics on TLC and Discovery Channel that i might stumble across.
35,Fellow Circle of Irony fools - To celebrate the sorta 6 month anniversary of Circle of Irony Ben (sorta) is having a dinner party (yes this mean you show uppay for your own dinner i pick the restaurant) on October 13th 6pm at Panda Garden on Grace St.
35,I LOVE THE FOOD NETWORK AND ALL THAT IT ENCOMPASSES IRON CHEF RULES I enjoy almost anything they re-run on A&E...Law & Order Third Watch Murder She Wrote Magnum PI L.A.
35,TITS WHEN AM I GONNA GROW TITS
35,I am still smoke-free...my last cigarette was Thursday night/Friday morning at midnight.
35,and now the moment you've all been waiting for... the Circle Of Irony Lack Of Participation Awards now that the 6-month anniversary of the Circle Of Irony has come (and gone) it's time to recognize those members of the Circle who have better things to do than posting to the blog.
35,are you still not smoking angie how many folks on this blog smoke
35,Actually bling-bling is usually 'ice' or diamonds especially when encrusted in a giant medallion hung about one's neck.

35,mm ... words worth a thousand pictures - 'i love you'
35,I adore Matlock but it acts as a morphine injection when I watch it...and I don't think I should combine percocet and morphine.
35,A thought that just crossed my mind just now: Is there ever a case where one word is ever worth a thousand pictures
35,Pink's already done not sure about Phoenix tho'.
35,PS - Matlock kicks Murder She Wrote's ass any day of the week.
35,How about Pink or the Phoenix in Carytown or Chop Suey Books
35,I prefer to be whipped only by quadriplegic midgets who can play the Star Spangled Banner on a $5 Casio keyboard with their tongue.

35,Oh I know you were joking about my joke Mir... That was just a preemptive comment on my part should I start to say REALLY weird shit.
35,Okay I guess from now on my humorous remarks will come after the serious ones.
35,okay maybe i'm not getting something angie but you see my comment was a joke in response to your joke.
35,I would have put a hyperlink for the article but that site requires a password to read their articles.
35,You're right..Johnathan never worked at Kings MF Dominion.
35,thanks for posting the article mir - if possible please post a hyperlink to the story.
35,i'm sorry that i didn't let the group know but the washington post article was an editorial.

35,I couldn't get it to work actually.
35,Did you guys even look at the link Jeez...
35,Unlike such women who need Halloween to find and exploit what sexuality they feel they lack I use it as an excuse to flaunt publicly what I normally (for the sake of societal propriety) downplay.
35,i think ted rall has lost his goddamn mind.
35,yeah i noticed that one year when ben and i were at a halloween party at shockoe arts center.
35,Speaking of Catholic School Girls there was a recent website that talked about how women now use Halloween as an excuse to dress sluty instead of scary.
35,I wanted to but my honey and myself are SWAMPED with school work.
35,'One more day 'til Halloween Halloween Halloween.

35,if i hold my breath long enough i see the face of god and He says to me boogie my son lay down the groove and boogie unfortunately right about that time i pass out
35,what warbot had to say about me Gatekeepers in paradise by R. Robot 'There could be some unwelcome consequences' said Mir this week in a dream I recently had.
35,Interestingly enough I sometimes believe in the world moreso than myself...
35,angie your last posting on deeply breathing made me cry.
35,Mir - In my opinion yes one can sacrifice one's mood for the happiness of another.
35,can one sacrifice one's own mood for another's happiness are some of us connected in some type of stronger way than others or is it something we just tell ourselves in order to feel more significant - less ephemeral
35,group: i apologize for using the blog in this way but i just wanted to let you know that i'm home sick for those of you who email me.
35,I would counter that there is now a precedent for federal court intervention in federal elections and that there is a constitutional basis for it.

35,When You are Old W. B. Yeats When you are old and grey and full of sleep And nodding by the fire take down this book And slowly read and dream of the soft look Your eyes had once and of their shadows deep; How many loved your moments of glad grace And loved your beauty with love false or true But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you And loved the sorrows of your changing face; And bending down beside the glowing bars Murmur a little sadly how Love fled And paced upon the mountains overhead And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
35,The Second Coming Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre will not hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world The blood-dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction while the worst Are full of passionate intensity.

35,i just got ben's christmas present through an auction yay
35,Ben - I did not answer the questions because the rephrasing seemed to suggest that the words weren't read at all which annoyed me because I was in a mood conducive to such.
35,just read angie's site - you go jamie lee curtis and let's hear it for soft fatty little tummys and back fat i have honestly thought at times that i was the only woman with back fat.
35,i miss emailing stupid comments and questions to ben at his workplace.
35,I actually have been hearing about this for a while since the guitar player for my band works there at the SPCA...he said he wished that he were treated as well as the animals were so apparently they're livin' pretty swanky.

35,mir's movie reviews 8-mile - good film.

35,- My thoughts and actions may or may not be the result of societal influence.
35,let me rephrase: are you stating that societal mores are irrevelant to you and that you think each individual should determine their own responsibilities as opposed to having it dictated to them by a governmental body or group of individuals
35,In my opinion these are questions that a society asks for itself.
35,you know the more i think about this the more it just infuriates me.

35,does the fact that i imagine d&d fight scenes while listening to rush in my car make me a geek
35,yeah i knew the posts didn't look appropriate juxtaposed but damn that vs fashion show joke was good :)
35,That post was in reference to your comment about the VS fashion show btw.
35,as you read this section of the article and perhaps the rest of the article keep in mind that these soldiers were trained with U.S. money and support: But in the middle of Dianna Ortiz's torture something distinctly inimical to torture happens.

35,Having grown up in Mississippi I can say with some certainty that I agree with my future husband about his assessment of Lott.
35,chris i compared strom thurmond to adolf hitler not trent lott.
35,It seems to me that neither Republicans nor Democrats ever really discuss what I would call politics.
35,Oh Mir -- it's nice to see that things haven't changed As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler.
35,because of the karl and maggie show exposing trent lott's record he is resigning from his leadership post.
35,I have nothing interesting to say but I wish good things to all.
35,actually on the 27th at any time.

35,ben was in a serious car accident last night.

35,Baby I remember all the things you taught me...
35,ben is signing the papers for his house tonight - congratulations ben
35,I must take issue with such a sweeping statement -- I for one am not 'culturally set up' to do this.
35,quote from allan gurganus: We're all culturally set up to look for that one other beloved object who will complete us and satisfy us and sate us and make us look good.
35,I now have True Blue going through my head.
35,Uma Therman can't hold a candle to Bea Arthur with a strap-on
35,ben had just made out with ethan hawke and i was getting ready to watch uma thurman strip to 'underneath it all' when the damn phone rang.
35,Personally I have nothing against predictable movies.
35,chris i actually saw the film mbfgw - and this was before it became 'popular.'
35,you are already my soul sister angie.
35,1989 - 'Epic' 1991 - 'Losing My Religion' 1994 - 'Black Hole Sun' 2002 - 'Lose Yourself' My goodness but that 8-year lag was too long.
35,'Toe pick' I like the Cutting Edge too.
35,I never thought boys were gross.
35,Some random popcorn movies I consider equal to the Greats: Die Hard Raiders of the Lost Ark Star Wars Jaws Goldfinger The Matrix (with reservations) Terminator 2 (the first I consider only borderline popcorn like Alien or Blade Runner) Aliens True Lies Dirty Harry Ghostbusters Animal House Back to the Future Beverly Hills Cop Wargames Trek II Lethal Weapon.
35,I have not seen the movie and really had no intention to but Julie wants to rent it on DVD so we will rent it at some point.
35,All right now Keeng I never said that I hated MBFGW.
35,You're right -- success does affect my opinion.
35,I sort of boycotted the film mainly because I don't like 'look it's funny 'cause their culture is different from our culture' movies.
35,It would be nice if from an emissions standpoint the SUV was classified as a truck instead of a car.
35,And with the crack of ice breaking on concrete all her plans and all her schemes collapsed in a single cascade of glittering regret -- only to tumble and pour and pile into an awesome tower of sparkling rage brilliant and hard and cold under the pitiless winter sun.
35,You're gonna see your sheba shimmy shake.
35,I have never seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- I just chose to hate it as an act of personal freedom.
35,I'm sure that's nice for some people but I've about had my fill in life of only realizing something's worth by losing it.
35,sometimes the best way to be reminded of something is by its absence.
35,oh my god i hated my big fat greek wedding too johnathan and i are soul sisters
35,In retrospect I was pretty much describing the average American in that last post so to include SUVs was irrelevant.
35,I just think they look cool.
35,SUVs....for myself if I had kids I'd prefer the Honda Odyssey.
35,john i'm sorry you're so upset about the loss of the holy ghost.
35,so true: After several gentle conversations I have finally gotten my fianc to share his fantasy with me: He wants to have sex on the top of a bunk bed.

35,i think we can all agree that angie is a wonderful human being and that we all wish her well.
35,I will keep Angie in my prayers.
35,The only arrogance I personally see in Bush II is his language which places him and America as the representatives of Good capital G and our enemies as representatives of Evil capital E. This kind of language scares and enrages me regardless of the speaker.
35,Good luck to Chirs on the interview.
35,Unless he has been keeping a big secret or been spreading misinformation no.
35,Wow a debate with more than me and Mr. Wigglepants involved.
35,Disclaimer: The ideological phallus of which I spoke or rather the waving of such refers primarily to government officials of all stripes and the numerous pundits and talking heads who appear in the various media.
35,Question -- 'We must engage the parts of the world that hate us' -- is that what we're about to do with the 101st Airborne Yikes indeed.
35,Thanks for the dance response -- I understood it better than the previous post.
35,And and.... Mir -- I hope you are feeling better soon.
35,And we are addressing (kida) the deed with Iraq leaving the reason for later -- but if you are fighting a fire in an oil rig you have to put out the flames before you can shut off the oil flow....
35,And let's run with the World Dance Party scenario: Yes we're at a party and yes we're playing some pretty rockin' dance music (the remix of Oingo Boingo's 'Dead Man's Party' sounds pretty good to me right now...) and yes we'd love for everyone to dance.
35,'I liked Reaganomics a lot -- it's got a good beat and I can dance to it.'
35,well mr. wigglepants since i have no health insurance it is difficult for me to see a doctor.
35,Johnathan just much more aptly illustrated the point I was trying to make in my most recent post.
35,Miriam -- have you seen a doctor or are you hoping one will appear in your drug-induced haze
35,i have had the flu since friday night.
35,Bear in mind that I am not at all articulate about such things but I have to say that I don't like the image presented by CK's argument.
35,Sadly I think you are right in the solution of wiping all extremists out but that will not happen nor should it.
35,Clarification: I do not define appeasement by addressing an attacker's complaints while simultaneously exacting wholesale and decisive retaliation for that individual's attack which is the argument I am making.
35,And you posted twice too :) Missed you today...hope you're feeling better soon hon...
35,hey guys - i had the flu today - threw up twice hurrah sorry i missed the game.
35,If I am understanding you correctly you think the heart of their hatred for the USA is related to our support for Israel and the presence of troops in Saudi Arabia.
35,If we don't have anything the fire ants want they go away.
35,If we prod the nest of fire ants we get swarmed.
35,what we need right now is a well thought out and cutting rebuttal from mr. chris king.
35,To clarify: I said the Bush administration had a strong case but exchanged it for weaker one.
35,I'm sure this will surprise few (if any) of you.
35,Regardless of one's opinion regarding Iraq it is undeniable that should individuals or groups decide to retaliate it will be us -- you me our families our friends -- who will be the favored target.
35,from an article in the washington post No definitive price tag or time limit has been put on the plan and officials stressed that much remains unknown about the length of a potential conflict how much destruction would result and 'how deep' the corruption of the Iraqi government goes.
35,op ed from the ny times February 21 2003 The Martial Plan By PAUL KRUGMAN he Marshall Plan was America's finest hour.

35,now i desperately want to play risk - and i'm not going to hold back next time.
35,We continue to avoid the strongest argument: Even though Asia is worth 7 armies there are only three reasons to hold the Middle East: (1) as a buffer for holding Africa (2) as a buffer for holding Europe (though the Ukraine and Southern Europe are the weaker points); and (3) as a launching point for the seizing of Australia.

35,'...U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warns Syria that the U.S. considers military shipments to Iraq a 'hostile act.''
35,Come on conservatives 120000 more ground troops are on the way Soon hundreds maybe thousands will be gassed or diseased and your suspicions will be quickly and effectively proved true The Arab world trembles before our might and no terrorist would ever think of striking back now that they've seen how strong we are And democracy is about to dawn across the Middle East Yet the Blog remains silent Come on kids -- this is your day Speak up Praise Attack Gloat Something

35,Looks like another 120000 troops will be on their way soon How big is our military anyway I have no idea.

35,B5 Season 2 on DVD - 4/29/03 Chewbacca to be in Episode III.
35,Miriam (Congratulations BTW) you are making some gross as in large assumptions concerning the looting.
35,Perhaps I am not being clear.
35,I appreciate your opinion re: the issue of liberating the Iraqi people from a ruthless dictator.
35,Ok you're right about the slippers.
35,that's not entirely my point harmony.
35,Do you think if America were invaded and the government overthrown that we would have looted the Smithsonian 'Dammit I just GOTTA have Dorothy's Ruby Slippers Now's my chance'
35,So it is our responsibility to protect people from looting or destroying their own nation's culture and history
35,i would think that people are upset about the looting of the iraqi's muesums because the u.s. military did nothing to protect them.
35,Clarificaton: I am specifically addressing the artifact/museum issue.
35,I've been thinking about this...how exactly is it our fault if Iraqis loot their own historical artifacts They're not our children.
35,I dig on my tan-in-a-can tan.
35,thought i would share something from my online journal: 2/25/2003 12:13:22 AM | bouncy bouncy] i was thinking about johnathan - about my friends - about life.
35,(doorbell) (answers door) Yes Arf (closes door) (doorbell) Yes (sees sign around dog's neck - in messy crayon) (tilts head reads) Sarah...Connor Yes I'm Sarah Connor.
35,Picturing that dog driving a semi into anything has got to be the funniest shit I've thought about all day.
35,That's what they all say...right before he drives a semi headlong into the steel factory where you're hiding.
35,Awwwwww....bwess his widdle heawt yes he did get all hurted and stuff....
35,Actually if you check CNN almost
35,a fairly inept terminator though wouldn't you say
35,From CNN: 'Dog hit by car shot by cop left for dead -- and lives' Little did they know that this was no dog -- it was the new T-201 a killing machine sent back from a dark future programmed for a single deadly purpose....
35,borderline feels like I'm going to lose my mind you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
35,okay waaaaay too much information about johnathan at cap one.
35,That scene describes many of my days since the first time Johnathan asked me...and the subsequent times he asked...although it may have been a Backstreet Boys shirt.
35,yes you are correct angie - another error.
35,If I weren't naked I'd run around working.
35,Go ahead and tentatively add Tracy (my brother) and Julie (his girlfriend).
35,and yes there are many misspellings in my posts.
35,list thus far for may 10th dinner - miriam richard ben joriel johnathan angie liz (punchline) pete (punchline) michaux greg rebecca brennan chris and mystery date..... ;) others have been invited - who will accept jimi tree john and even more have been invited who haven't quite confirmed yet and remember this extragant affair will be taking place at pasta luna (we're crazy about pasta) at 7pm on May 10th.
35,In Germany it's a celebration of killing yourself.
35,you both have lost yoru monds
35,my hair is covered in hemp
35,everybody run / the homecoming queen's got a gun
35,i love you more than i can say.
35,always gotta rain on my destiny parade don't you
35,I didn't say you would want to meet it...
35,my first question: are you going to tell us the truth or merely lies
35,5) Will the male 12-year-old target audience ever figure out that their fantasy hottie is old enough to be their mother 6) Will Neo recreate the Matrix to resemble the world of Point Break 7) Will Morpheus tell anyone about his hidden stash of cheeseburgers
35,Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.
35,I could also have had an obtuse moment.
35,I caught it the first time.
35,Babylon 5 Season 3 -- August 12
35,He's the fellow who Smith blends with before he can reach the phone.
35,spoiler for those of you who havne't seen matrix reloaded: i didn't know this until i read it on this modern world: the guy at the end is the 'human' agent smith i totally missed it while watching it.
35,In a recent interview Joss shares the irony that he was able to tell the story he wanted to tell in the Buffy movie -- about a ditzy and self-absorbed girl becoming heroic -- through Cordelia from her run on 'Buffy' through to her arc on 'Angel'.
35,The multiple Agent Smiths was the kind of thing I had hoped we'd see in Episode II.
35,Oh Jesus that would have been funny.
35,in the scene with the multiple mr. smiths i kept waiting for them to break out into sometype of line kicking routine.
35,I've been going through the motions Walking through the part Nothing seems to penetrate my heart
35,I also enjoyed the fight scenes.
35,I liked watching people kick ass.
35,look at my supple french breasts and i will tell you everything you wish to know.
35,Oh silly of course I know I'm important I appreciate the thought but it's really okay to go on without me.
35,I'm sure Angie appreciates her importance and the game will not be postponed.
35,why don't we just postpone the game until finney can join us i don't think waiting another 2 weeks would kill anyone.
35,Johnathan's right...I will sadly be unable to join you all at Sunday's game.
35,The good news is Angie is very pleased with the results -- not only will her Movement rate increase by 5 but she won't have to lose the 'Great Cleavage' feat.
35,From what I can gather as an observer the effect of breast reduction surgery is similar to being hit square and full force in the chest with a baseball bat.
35,Are you going to show us on Sunday ;) Wait a sec....
35,Thanks guys for all the support.
35,One can always count on Madonna to keep abreast of current blog postings.
35,tried that - they kept getting out of the pot.
35,You could just make stew of them for Richard tonight; say they're at a friend's house.
35,i'm watching my 2 stepchildren today and they are trying me nuts.
35,good idea johnathan and quite tasty.
35,From The Washington Post summarized in The Week: About 40000 human embryos are being stored in freezers in fertility clinics throughout the U.S.
35,i would say his since he actually wrote the script.
35,JS -- take care of that woman my friend.
35,Angie came out of surgery fine and asked me to give a shout out to the bloggers.
35,witness the eerie silence and tremble my fellow bloggers and geeks....
35,and i may be a so-so girlfriend but i am a kick-ass ex-girlfriend.
35,i think ben was just trying to be funny about the buffy stuff - i remember when it was basically just ben and me on the blog everyday and i'm sure he is thrilled that the blog is so active and people have something to say.
35,Chris - I did see Farscape from time to time.
35,Enterprise - With the more serious overtones being set up for next season does anyone think that we may be seeing the beginnings of the Empire instead of the Federation
35,Ben - Your post struck a nerve which surprises me.
35,my thoughts and wishes are with angie today.
35,I watched the last episode of Buffy.
35,You awake with an upset stomach in bed with Pat Buchanan.
35,what would happen if you took the blue pill and the red pill at the same time awareness without action action without thought
35,I wonder if I will ever be in a villain's clutches.
35,CK - Since I am purchasing the B5 DVDs as they are released I do not need the VHS tapes anymore.
35,I'm sure that if the blog existed when B5 was on the air -- or Twin Peaks before that -- there would be just as many commentaries questions and complaints.
35,i was starting to seriously consider setting up a second 'buffy blog' for you guys - but then i realized that if i did this blog would be empty until the series was over.
35,The only discrepancy in the whole article that troubled me was Bush's insistence that he initially watched it on television if the evidence shows he did not.
35,I agree with Johnathan about the stupidity of his being robbed of choice in the end.
35,I was wondering how you were doing today Angie.
35,Ben - I read some of the article and skimmed other parts.
35,Spike is dead and I'm having a shit day.
35,I agree with some of your points and disagree with others.
35,as far as all the potential slayers becoming slayers at the same time i don't think that was heavy-handed or took away from the message of personal empowerment.
35,I enjoyed Buffy's solution and a few of the exchanges.
35,so you did or did not like the finale harmony i loved it.
35,oh yeah i laughed so hard - they were playing d&d and making a homestar runner reference.
35,Why is it so hard to create a movie or television episode that gives me more than a few really good moments Why are writers so lazy that they expect me to fill in the blanks Why do writers receive so much notoriety not for being very careful and attentive to the story but for succeeding in climbing awkwardly out of the corner into which they have painted themselves Always always always leave the party when everyone is having a good time.
35,Ok so of my list of fatalities I got one and a half right - Spike and Anya.
35,OK peeps catching up on the blog (and I didn't have to go all the way to the bottom of the 100 post view) JS -- I realized tonight that I still have your video tape with Season 3 of B5 (Angie's Journey caused the lightbulb to fizzle on).
35,10 minutes until the end of buffyverse.
35,3 hours 45 minutes to the end of Buffy.
35,why threat level orange i thought it was threat level tangerine.
35,Threat level orange Threat level orange
35,i just checked the mirror and you harmony the june bug are correct
35,I thought it was an octality theory.
35,i'm probably becoming fascinated by minutia here but the 'upper / lower case' labeling interests me.
35,i feel it coming upon me - like ivy creeping up the walls of harvard like mold growing on the walls of a public bathroom like litter flaking slowly from a cat's paw - it's dinner party time again time - first weekend of august - (first saturday) place - mekong who's invited - everybody everybody
35,i suppose in some ways i'm a sucker for ben's chaos/order duality theory.
35,I agree -- illustrating extremes is an effective way to reveal the uncertain middle.
35,i agree that there are no absolutes and none should be attempted.
35,Two cents: wrong and evil and for that matter right and good are not the same thing.
35,in response: i am aware of the difference between the upper and lower case 'republican' and 'democrat.'
35,r/R d/D: The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.
35,I have observed that Social Darwinists are often ignorant of the interdependencies that got them where they are.
35,JLS - i've not heard of the difference between 'upper-' and 'lower-case' democracts and republicans.
35,part of the difficulty one faces with bringing such arguments to certain republican mindsets: sometimes you're dealing with social darwinists who believe that only the strong will (and should) survive.
35,I was with you until the last sentence.
35,to bring up a topic that was introduced yesterday during game - you need to have good educational system in order to form a peaceful and strong society.
35,i just got back from ben's house wheee
35,Difficult to type -- ears bleeding --
35,because so far i've listened to it 2000 times.
35,yay did you like the audioblog thing
35,I am in your house right now
35,and my phone isn't working - i'm here though
35,okay that is too funny... and aren't you supposed to be at my house in about 10 minutes
35,or you mo-fos can't join my posse if you got a prob with bro-bro love dig
35,american association of law schools will not permit a school to join which discrimates against homosexuals during the job-interview process which is a very important part of the law school experience for the students.
35,'I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.'
35,Same reason why Batman can't turn his head.
35,Justice Scalia's (who may be chief justice soon) opinion on the same case: June 27 2003 | Today's opinion is the product of a Court which is the product of a law-profession culture that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.
35,I mean I like what the guy said and his actual words made perfect sense but what's it's context I have no information about the case to which this pertains.
35,Ummm....what Where did this come from and what does it all mean man
35,Following are excerpts from Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas handed down June 26.
35,i just the new madonna video 'hollywood' and that is embarrassing for everyone involved.

35,Actually a friend of mine invited me to join that site.
35,Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it Come on now everybody We've got it goin' on for years
35,i have once again fallen prey to angie's quizzes.
35,I was looking on the RPG calendar and i saw we have a rtg scheduled for july 19th and and hos on july 20th is this true
35,You dressed up as Threepio I cannot even begin to wrap my head around the unbearably goobish cuteness of the image that conjurs.
35,Borders Books+Music on West Broad is going all out with the imminent Harry Potter volume.

35,K being referrred to as your bride just sent me into the Nth tier of GiddyVille.
35,Don't leave my bride holding all the non-postaged invitations while you frolic in sinville now...
35,i can't tell you how much better that makes me feel.
35,If it's any consolation that is not the final song from Grease which is actually 'We Go Together.'
35,i have the final song from grease going through my head and it won't stop.
35,Going to cancun before the wedding But...that's....that's....why you'll be living in sin
35,for those of you who don't know my wedding has been postponed until next april or something like that.
35,...in the land of Marriage where the Husbands lie.
35,sharp ring - but of course i liked the other ring too.
35,In the old days women just gestured more with their left hands.
35,Don't be fooled by the rocks that she got She's still she's still Angie from the block We be engaged Or rather more so than before.
35,oh yeah i got my cable modem back funky chicken.
35,okay i have just figured out how to use this - so it looks fine - the new template makes me cry.
35,Whoa Ben got a new template Looks good bro With the all new system do they have new templates now 'Cause a lot of the old ones sucked.
35,Yelahneb - neither the most current version of IE for Mac nor Mac's own new browser Safari display Blogger normally.
35,BACH I was howling when I read the Plush Cthulu Tale.
35,Well I guess I have a more updated version of IE at home than I do at work because I am not stuck with the crappy Lo-Fi sht.
35,JLS - i don't think the OS is the issue; the message you received was 'This version of Blogger has been designed for web browsers that lack robust Stylesheet and/or DHTML capabilities.'
35,The Chewie thing is so retarded that I can't even think about it.
35,i read the whole story ben and it was bizarre.
35,i tell you what people - cavalier dsl sucks
35,The new Blog design must be for XP users -- neither my 95 PC at work nor my OS X Mac at home can view the page in anything other than 'Blogger LoFi.'
35,Harmony -- yes I have focused on my breathing in such a way from time to time.
35,they afraid that if it's legalized they won't be able to resist that temptation to go out and fuck other men.
35,What could possibly be so threatening about same-gender marriage that the Executive branch is expending the time and energy to outlaw it -- Annoyed Republican
35,i haven't but i have at times become hyper-aware of color and wondered if there are colors i've never seen before.
35,Have you ever become so aware of your own breathing that for a brief moment you become terrified that if you stop consciously thinking about it your body won't do it on its own
35,ummm...what I have to wait 'til I get home to hear AudBlog posts...dammit I'm missing out on all the fun And that onion article...WTF

35,There was a blog on the 'recently published' list just now that was called 'My Boyfriend is a Twat.'
35,maybe i've been reading your site or following you around and secretly listening to you - either way.
35,Dude you just posted the lyrics to an Air Supply song.
35,i'm not moving to nova until next june.
35,The Police reference the Scylla and Charybdis in 'Wrapped Around Your Finger' Mir.
35,what the hell are you talking about harmony
35,NoVa and Capital One The Scylla and Charybdis of central Virginia
35,i'm not sure if that's going to work - the poopoo head comment is only so effective.
35,GAH Don't leave us Mir Tell Richard he's a big poopoo stinkyhead if he takes away our Mir pouts
35,richard's ex-bitch is taking the kids up to the maryland/dc area so jack (he has autism) can get proper treatment which is not available in va unless you happen to have 55000 dollars laying around to pay for it.
35,Why on earth would you do that and if you must when What the hell is going on I'm so confused.
35,i don't want to move to NoVA
35,How does it feel How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone

35,Re: drum circle epiphany...Ben I can only HOPE you were stoned when you recorded that...
35,Good night Was that Johnathan laughing like a maniac
35,Here in this place I have no sound
35,so no one was amused by the old JLS voicemail i love it.
35,Johnathan you are such a sick puppy.
35,And I liked the new Strong Bad email.
35,Dude like NONE of my friends on Blogger or LJ are posting anything.
35,the new strong bad email - not so good.
35,and sometimes people do very brave and wonderful things - strange world.
35,i tell you what people will spaz over the strangest things.
35,you are such a freak ben.
35,Did you mean to post the same story twice
35,richard and i will be unable to go - we have the boys this weekend - and since i'm going to be gone all weekend i'd like to spend some time with them.
35,i do indeed have to work and will miss the fun; i thought perhaps others might want to go though.
35,Angie and I will not be able to attend.
35,Perhaps but that is not my point.
35,but without free will there are no options; just the illusion of choice exists.
35,Free will always results in loss of control.
35,If it helps red I was put here to test you.
35,red - perhaps you could start by thinking about the design on your back.
35,That's oen of the reasons why I believe in God...'cause I feel like too much happens that seems to be meant for the enlightenment of myself and others.
35,really do you ever feel like there are people or situations in the world that exist to test you i know that claims alot of ego because that would mean that somewhere in the universe someone or something is concerned about your individual enlightenment - but it does seem that way sometimes.
35,i suppose my question is then how do we get the two to harmonize
35,Unless emotion and intellect are in harmony it is unlikely one knows at all.
35,why is it we can know something so firmly and completely intellectually but still be unable to comprehend it emotionally
35,For that matter one could say all ideologies are absolutist.
35,Cameron Frye was the legendary best friend of Ferris.
35,Mir my dear...liberals are also absolutistic.
35,conversatives do have the advantages of being absolutistic
35,For those who go to Shore Leave and feel there's nothing to do in the town we saw/found: 4 sushi restaurants several seafood restaurants several Italian restaurants a delightful polynesian sno-cone shop multiple pubs a tobacconist a nifty aquarium specialty store an ice cream vendor a huge 50s-style diner with 24-hour breakfasts of massive proportions dozens of antique stores a hobby shop several consignment shops a nice non-chain bookstore and a giant fox.

35,Usually as the format of the text suggests.
35,ok i think i understand your definition of the 'shrug' - but what about the timing aspect that i mentioned is the shrug occuring within the post or a moment later as the format of the text suggests
35,Umm as a New Yorker I must make an alternate orthographical suggestion: 'fuhggedaboudit.'
35,life is sweet life is awesome baby child.
35,queer eye is coming on tonight
35,Perhaps the network is attempting to scare away Republicans who might be afraid that their TV will give them cooties -- or worse that they might be caught watching the wrong thing when Jesus returns in all His glory to separate the straight wheat from the queer chaff.
35,benji can you hear me benji can you shrug me hey a question for everyone what is your favorite woody allen film mine would be manhattan.

35,okay harmony what is the empathy am i feeling the love
35,I don't know if it's Bravo's official stance to be the gay network but they certainly are the snooty art snob network which kind of lends itself to the whole gay thing.
35,Two off the wall and totall non related questions for the off the wall and mostly non related people on this Blog 1) Is Bravo known as a gay network (ala Lifetime for women and Spike for men).

17,I blogged out on xanga... silly Rachel.
17,So I'm kind of behind on recent events but I really don't feel like typing out every thing that's happened in the past week or so... it hasn't exactly been a good week...
17,so I've been awake for two hours now.
17,so I've been remembering how I used to be.
17,Jimmy Eat World-- My Sundown I see it around me I see it in everything.
17,So I'm reading Margaret Atwood again... 'Out of the gravel there are peonies growing They come up through the loose grey pebbles their buds testing the air like snails' eyes then swelling and opening huge dark red flowers all shining and glossy like satin.
17,So I've been being really bad lately.
17,I told my chemistry teacher that I haven't been sleeping much lately and she was like ' Rachel that's bad.
17,for some reason I find that disturbing....
17,Notes on yesterday: I'm not sure you even noticed.
17,You know what's really bad When its only the second week of school and you're already so stressed out about school that you intentionally go to the library and get really dorky girly books about dorky girly teenage girls... who are dorky and girly {get the point} and always have adorable boyfriends and do the most dorky girly things that are so stupid you laugh out loud in your bedroom all by yourself when really you should be doing your chem lab instead of reading dorky girly books... and now I'm going to go attempt to go finish my chem lab... or maybe study for the Latin test
17,I am fully and completely exhausted.
17,Well I am an official Catholic on my own now.
17,beyond my wants... beyond my fears... what is this that I fear what is this that terrifies me so why so many questions yes yet another ironic isn't it the walls of my head are a prison.
17,well I really cried today... violent sobs yeah all that... it was really bad.
17,Goodnight I'm going to bed to see if I can sleep this off.
17,I need to escape from my house... will you come kidnap me please I'll tie my sheets together and I can climb out my window and then we can go sit out in the middle of nowhere and look at mars k
17,Ok so I'm getting really sick of my parents freaking out every time I want to do something.
17,can you tell my brain is fried today and I'm bored so I'm coming up with random things to post First best friend(s):Ryan... he was my next door neighbor First real memory of something: I think its riding our big wheels down the hill we used to live on a break neck speeds... First car: my lil' white mazda First date: um...well... that depends... First real kiss: oh... First job: working at my dad's office First screen name: um I think it was the one my dad came up with for me... Im4vball First self purchased album: um...
17,hmmmmmmmmmm...................... You have a mysterious kiss.
17,Interesting conversation I had today: Sarah was talking about how Chandler didn't seem her usual perky self today and then she said 'well but then again nobody's very perky today... except for you Rachel you're always perky.
17,Good Morning... did you know that its easier to sleep until eleven when its cloudy and the sun doesn't come up shining right in your window
17,So its that same question I've been asking since I was old enough to have my own identity {about third grade} Who am I really and who do I want to be Do I want to be the person I know people want me to be because I want other people to be happy and so I will be who I am to make them so Do I want to be the person I know my parents want me to be Do I want to be sweet and innocent Do I want to be strong and powerful Can I be both Do I want to be the person that can be depended on to always say 'Yes' Do I want to be the one people feel protective of and be 'babied' to a point Do I want to be the one who is wildly successful though has given up every thing else to be so WHO DO I WANT TO BE WHO AM I NOW am I who I've heard people think I am Am I really the one who {supposedly} when my best friend is having her first child will be in the amazon connected by cell phone yelling support Am I the graceful beauty some people say I am {though I see things quite differently} Am I as 'good' as I've heard others say {I know I'm not.}
17,So I had another revelation while I was driving with the radio off tonight.
17,I want for everything to just be fine for a while.
17,So yesterday I went to the Kansas City Art Institute to have my portfolio reviewed and I think it went really well.
17,ARG oh look I have 705 hits... that's a lot though not considering how long I've had that counter up.
17,So yeah now I'VE copied it... but I need to save it because I think its something I should read every now and again.
17,Are you gonna live your life wonderin' standing in the back lookin' around Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you've grown up or how you missed out Things are never gonna be the way you want.
17,'It's dark as a stone in this room and hot as a roasting heart; if you atare into the darkness with your eyes open you are sure to see something after a time.
17,I'm having one of those nights.
17,I'm in the best mood today... and I had a lot of fun last night.
17,I think I'm having an identity crisis.
17,I'm getting kind of excited about NCYC.
17,I have way too much to do this weekend.
17,You know what I love This song: Switchfoot-- Meant to Live Fumbling his confidence And wond'ring why the world has passed him by Hoping that he's meant for more than arguments And failed attempts to fly fly We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves Somewhere we live inside Somewhere we live inside We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves Somewhere we live inside Dreaming about Providence And whether mice or men have second tries Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open Maybe we're bent and broken broken We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves Somewhere we live inside Somewhere we live inside We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves Somewhere we live inside We want more than this world's got to offer We want more than this world's got to offer We want more than the wars of our fathers And everything inside screams for second life We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves We were meant to live We were meant to live You know what else I love getting back my first roll of newspaper film and the majority of them are really good and they are ALL at least semi usable {can you say Photoshop} Ms. Rez calling me 'hon' which means she likes me which is neat because she's one of my favorite teachers.
17,when do I get my fairy tale
17,So Sama and Chantele and I have had a girls day out... it was fun... but now we're watching chik fliks... which all three of us have agreed have become horribly depressing... especially the kissing scenes...
17,Oh I wish for someone for you For you whom my heart whispers to in night When I am drowning in the darkness.
17,I feel really good about the past week.
17,This time I'm just going to sit and wait and take what comes to me.
17,Ok this song really is beautiful... its a duet on Matt Maher's cd called 'Set me as a Seal' Set me as a seal on your heart set me as a seal on your soul for strong as death is love unyielding as the grave.
17,for some reason I find this song just absolutely beautiful.
17,She said 'don't don't let it go to your head Boys like you are a dime a dozen Boys like you are a dime a dozen' She said 'you're a touch overrated you're a lush and I hate it but these grass stains on my knees they won't mean a thing' And all I (all I) Need to know (need to know) Is that I'm somethin you'll be missin (is that I'm somethin that you're missin) (maybe I should hate for this) Maybe I should hate you for this Never really did ever quite get that far (maybe I should hate for this) Maybe I should hate you for this Never really did ever quite get that...
17,jazzboyj99 [7:43 PM]: so have you recovered from NCYC Soybeenchik847 [7:43 PM]: not in the slightest Soybeenchik847 [7:44 PM]: I want to go back already jazzboyj99 [7:44 PM]: lol jazzboyj99 [7:44 PM]: why do you want to go back Soybeenchik847 [7:45 PM]: because I love that environment where I can actually decide what I want to do for myself and I love being around people who all believe the same thing I do and I want to be WARM again jazzboyj99 [7:45 PM]: did you gain anything spiritually from NCYC Soybeenchik847 [7:46 PM]: Yeah to me its real proof that what I live for is something real.
17,For some reason I have a facination with what people think of me or who people think of me as.
17,And so I'll promise you that none of this really matters.
17,So perhaps my puzzle pieces don't fit together the way I thought they had and need rearranging.
17,all I want is to be at peace at peace with my reason and my heart { Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point do look it up it might mean something to you... its french.}
17,You know for a while there I was terribly frightened.
17,hee hee I love foxtrot and there's an ad for EMU OIL on my blog... pure randomness
17,I think I want to get my hair cut like this.
17,I want to go see the Return of the King horribly so... Patience is a virtue.
17,its not what you think it is... please I begged you on my knees what more did you want you said I can't make it stop but you did eventually I haven't stopped bleeding bleeding for you my soul pouring out and draining away draining into your blue suffocating lungs sustaining life.
17,She said 'don't don't let it go to your head Boys like you are a dime a dozen Boys like you are a dime a dozen' She said 'you're a touch overrated you're a lush and I hate it but these grass stains on my knees they won't mean a thing' She says it's cold outside and she hands me a raincoat She's always worried about things like that She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault And she only sleeps when it's raining And she screams and her voice is straining She says baby It's 3 am I must be lonely When she says baby Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes Says the rain's gonna wash it away I believe it She's got a little bit of something God it's better than nothing And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to And she only sleeps when it's raining And she screams and her voice is straining She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway but outside it's stopped raining She dreams a champagne dream Strawberry surprise pink linen and white paper Lavender and cream Fields of butterflies reality escapes her She says that love is for fools who fall behind she woke in the morning she knew that her life had passed her by.
17,What if someday every thing I want is no longer what I want What if I find myself in the middle of Tibet in a buddhist monestary on assignment from National Geographic {I can't even begin to make you understand how wonderfully beautiful that sounds now} and I find that I despise the lifestyle I've taken on What if my passion ceases to be passionate What will I do now I suppose that for now all I can do is be as fervently passionate as I can... because a fire that burns higher than the trees cannot possibly be extinguished in a single moment... can it and look there's 900 hits... soon I'll have a thousand... that's kind of cool.
17,one more thing before I go to bed...{I have to get up early in the morning and go to church to practice our music for Christmas Eve.}
17,what're the bets on how long this purple/pink/girly/kinda sickening layout lasts I'm not even really in that kind of mood... it just happened... blech.
17,^this is where I spent my day today with my mom^
17,'You're the most beautiful person I know.'
17,Yellowcard--Ocean Avenue There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day staying up all night Staying up all night There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day staying up all night Staying up all night If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go it's everything I see When I sleep I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise Be together for one more night Somewhere somehow If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
17,I have decided that I hate hospitals.
17,OH and the Return of the King comes out tomorrow.
17,I'm watching My Fair Lady It's been my favorite musical since I was four or something... yes four.

17,I feel self-contained right now which is good.
17,'My mother was right when she said my father was good.
17,So maybe I'm even weirder than I thought I was.
17,I was just re-reading Walk Two Moons by Sharon Creech.
17,The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top The snow is softly fallin' The air is still within the silence of my room I hear your voice softly callin' If I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead My glass is almost empty I read again between the lines upon the page The words of love you sent me If I could know within my heart That you were lonely too I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you The fire is dying now my lamp is growing dim The shades of night are liftin' The mornin' light steals across my windowpane Where webs of snow are driftin' If I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love And to be once again with with you To be once again with with you I'm tired of dreaming about my future...
17,Hold me close Baby please Tell me anything But that youre gonna leave As I kiss this falling tear I promise you I will be here 'Til the stars fall from the sky 'Til I find a reason why And darling as the years go by 'Til theres no tears left to cry 'Til the angels close my eyes And even if were worlds apart I'll find my way back to you by heart When you go Ill stop the clock I wont ever Let this moment stop Time is stealin you from me But it can never take this memory 'Til the stars fall from the sky 'Til I find a reason why And darling as the years go by 'Til theres no tears left to cry 'Til the angels close my eyes And even if were worlds apart I'll find my way back to you by heart 'Til the stars fall from the sky 'Til I find a reason why And darling as the years go by 'Til theres no tears left to cry 'Til the angels close my eyes And even if were worlds apart I'll find my way back to you by heart how ironic it is the way things work out.

17,Well this time I'm just going to let it go.
17,Damien Rice - Cannonball Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt Still a little hard to say what's going on Still a little bit of your ghost your witness Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed You step a little closer each day That I can't see what's going on Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to lie Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall When you float like a cannonball Still a little bit of your song in my ear Still a little bit of your words I long to hear You step a little closer to me So close that I can't see what's going on Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to lie Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall When you float like a cannon Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to cry So come on courage Teach me to be shy 'Cause it's not hard to fall And I don't want to scare her It's not hard to fall And I don't wanna lose It's not hard to grow When you know that you just don't know Perhaps this is what I had intended all along.
17,This is the saddest movie I've seen in a long time.

17,'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.'
17,...I am horribly miserable with the way things are right now.

17,I'm so tired of being here suppressed by all my childish fears and if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase when you'd cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me you used to captivate me by your resonating light but now I'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase when you'd cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears and I've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone but though you're still with me I've been alone all along when you'd cried I'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears and I've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me me me.....
17,I have finally come to accept the fact that I am totally and completely truly alone on the face of this desolate planet.
17,Today I am stuck on the songs that mean something to me.
17,Kate told me I was an emo kid when she read this in my planner: in need of consolation I look to my new ruby sneakers {is there anywhere else but home} the gaiety of the eyeball white laces makes me want to wretch and the redness reminds me of your blood fresh from your throat which I slit.
17,Right now if I had no God I think I would be dead.
17,that which is unrequited is not love.

17,I love the sound of laughter.
17,3.somewhere i have never traveled gladly beyond any experience your eyes have their silence: in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me or which i cannot touch because they are too near; your slightest look easily will unclose me though i have closed myself as fingers you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens (touching skillfully mysteriously) her first rose; or if your wish be to close me i and my life will shut very beautifully suddenly as when the heart of this flower imagines the snow carefully everywhere descending; nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals the power of your intense fragility: whose texture compels me with the color of its countries rendering death and forever with each breathing; (i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) nobody not even the rain has such small hands.

17,I don't know what to say about anything.
17,IB is a bunch of crap and a waste of time.
17,I've been watching the show Room Raiders on MTV lately well ok since like September but ya I really like the show not because it's a dating show and what not but because it shows people's rooms and how they express themselves.

17,I hate how I act sometimes.
17,I'm so tierd exhausted and frusturated.
17,OY and BLAH no better way to explain how I'm feeling.
17,What's the point of life To love right But then what's the point of love the point within love I see no point anymore if the opportunity is right there and you can't even take it.... and if you do take it and if it just slips out of your hands once again no point.

17,Sorry I lie lax game is on Monday agaisnt EP at 5:30 but it's not at Blake it's at the Hopkins stadium even pimper.
17,So yesterday was the best lacrosse game ever if you weren't there you missed a lot we won 6-5 in the state quaterfinals and now we're playing EP in the semi-finals at 5:30 Monday I think at Blake.

17,Flowers bloom with the florescent smell surrounding your nose.
17,“There’s the wind up the pitch and a swing and a miss.” As the announcers say baseball may have its misses but still has many hits at that too.
17,The lost art of kissing By William D. Hicks Kissing plays an obvious and important role in romance.

17,Mornings suck when you get a note from your mom basically yelling and demanding to get a job even though you have been trying all along.
17,Hmmmm is it just me or does it seem like everyone has sex on their minds I mean ok what's new But now people are actually expressing their feelings about it and talking about it.
17,Nope that's all I got I just need a job badly.
17,I was thinking about what I wanted to be when I grew up and where I wanted to go and how capable I am at doing stuff and then that ended up leading to me thinking about how my grandparents have been together for a really long time and how cute and devoted they are.
17,So one day this girl met this guy.

24,Went to collect tix for my hols today... finally i can have a break... a break from work... a break from everything.
36,I have no idea what anyone is talking about.
36,Panda - report back on the status of 'The Big Breakfast' - I believe they cancelled it about a year ago I think I heard something like that when I was there.
36,I would go with 'stuffing' since traditionally it is 'stuffed' into the turkey.
36,Let's settle this: Do you call it dressing or stuffing Thanks Duf fer
36,I could have it no other way...Bea Arthur and I are soulmates... You are smart sensible and love your family.
36,Okay...so there's an e-mail in there.
36,Unfortunately DJS I think we're our only fans.
36,Does anyone ever check our e-mail I can't believe we don't have more fans.
36,I like the fishes cause they're so delicious.
36,Which Sesame Street Muppet Are You Stoner if it doesn't work out with Matt and if Karen and I fall on hard times...
36,Which Sesame Street Muppet Are You And now I am blind too.
36,Which Sesame Street Muppet Are You Ah...Christ.
36,Stoner: Go ahead and just take the rest of the day off.
36,Two more looooooong hours until this day is over.
36,This is why I NEVER eat in that dump.
36,SHOOT ME NOW I just spent my lunch time in the company-provided break room trying to peacefully eat my lunch and read my book.
36,True Confession Time/I'm Free/Helene Beware I can run but I cannot hide: I drink soy milk.
36,Helene it was I knew it from the first episode I ever watched -- I wasn't even swayed by Gwen.
36,Alright tonight it's going to be Helene all the way.
36,Duf 'Skorts' should definitely NOT have an asterisk next to them.
36,That's a funny question because off-hand I can think of a ton of things you are supposed to give up but never do.
36,Oh and one other thing women at this office can wear denim dresses and skirts on Monday through Thursday but men cannot wear denim pants (a.k.a.
36,HAL and I decided that there are things you have to give up when you become an adult.
36,MS Mail...oh God don't get me started.
36,Speaking of things people say that are wrong/funny: New Yorkers say 'dater' not 'data'.
36,That's probably how Winona rationalized it as well.
36,I would say: 'delta' 'raise the helicopter' 'bandwidth' 'value proposition' and my all time favorite (or least favorite as the case is) is: 'MS mail' HAL DJS and I work with a woman who cannot say e-mail for some reason.
36,My least favorite corporate phrases of the decade: 'Let's talk about your issues.'
36,Least favorite corporate phrase of the day: Human capital.
36,I went mental at the Virgin records megastore in Columbus.
36,Word to the wise: don't push the post & publish button twice
36,The 'Jig Off 2' part I like.
36,I thought Gino gave you his number so why don't you call him up and invite him Stoner could take my place in Jig Off 2 - the final chapter.
36,Hey guys Now it's time for me to reveal the real reason I'm coming back to work...
36,I think it's the real deal...it looks like he's got plenty o' make-up plastered on...and as for his schnozz I think it fell off a couple times hence the surgical mask he sometimes wears.
36,I saw that horrific picture earlier this morning.
36,Stoner - do you want every song on the album or just a few Because I am a master of disaster when it comes to downloading songs off the internet and burning them on CDs.
36,Stoner - I don't have a CD burner...but I reckon I could work something out because yes I'm down with the Toll House y'all.
36,You know how I sometimes bake cookies for Duf in return for musical masterpieces by people such as Dirty Vegas and Jack Johnson Anyone could get in on that deal if they wanted to...for example DJS if you and/or your girlfriend routed some of J. Timberlake's solo venture my way I'd make sure that some baked goods (of your personal preference although I do specialize in Toll House-related items) came back in your direction.
36,As some of you know my girlfriend Laura loves N'Sync and more specifically Justin Timberlake.
36,'Weapon of Choice' is a great song to listen to at work.
36,Newsflash: I believe there are going to be some individuals such as myself (sans boy) at the Country Bar on Saturday night.
36,Duf/Hal/DJS: How can I get a job working with you too I make a mean cup of coffee It seems nobody wants to hire a MBA from Chicago these days...Perhaps '2 Tickets 2 Paradise' needs a back-up-singer-girl for their occassional gig.
36,They just dropped the big bomb here at work...HAL is coming back to work with Duf and I (and there was much rejoicing...)
36,You know you're pathetically single when you eat bologna sandwiches for dinner.
36,In the immortal words of the Fatboys 'Can you feel it' Greetings from Columbus Ohio (the hardest hotel book in the world).
36,I hate this part of colds - my nose is chafed and flaking.
36,I need to get back in the writing swing of things.
36,Stoner I'll assume that they want you to work there.
36,I took photos but did not finish the roll...so it may be a little while before I send them to EVERYONE I KNOW.
36,Panda I would love to see photos.
36,I went to Milwaukee at the last minute on Saturday.
36,GossiP All women in Tampa wear thong underwear.
36,Hey it must be CD Friday I went out and scooped up Bjork's Greatest Hits .
36,Amazon finally sent me Tori Amos' latest album.
36,We missed you too Any gossip to share
36,I missed you all so much Stoner ease up on the taffy
36,Have you been eating the taffy again
36,Speaking of freakish neighbors...I have a few of my own.
36,So........ What do you do with a blue whale
36,Special Report: According to my voicemail here at work Hal has witnessed yet another letter on the door of our freakish neighbors apartment.
36,....8) To stay away from absinthe.
36,After speaking with Panda I'm worried.
36,I resolve to: 1) Never drink at work again.
36,Hal - Why you gotta be like that I haven't ruled it out but I'm telling you...getting ready to have clowns over is a big deal at our house.
36,I don't hold people to drinks.
36,So far today has been well-spent.
36,Hey if all this pimp/ho talk doesn't increase traffic to the site I don't know what will.
36,Yeah maybe I should get my hands on that Handbook.
36,Let me get one thing straight... Panda did not get laid.
36,I Leave Town for One Minute; 2 best: Turkey Hunting is Not What I Thought Let me get this straight - Hal and Panda are going to Phoenix in Feb. Stoner is leaving banking for masonry.
36,Thanks for the info about 'Gangs'...I was sceptical about that one.
36,Panda I'm in total compliance with you on both counts.
36,Funny movie disappointing movie Have any of you seen Jackass: the Movie It was really funny.
36,HAL you ignorant slut Somehow you captured the NY Jewess accent perfectly Boy was I snowed.
36,Panda time for me to fess up.
36,What kind of bizarro world do I live in I just got called by one of my managers in NY.
36,Yeah...Coldplay in Phoenix It sounds more like Hotplay.
36,Wow news travels fast 'round Pandyland.
36,Three Guesses Why are Panda and Hal going to Phoenix 1.
36,HAL and I are well on our way to sunny Phoenix in February.
36,Sure DJS for your needs Woodbury is a wonderful place.
36,Yeah I was pretty anti-Woodbury (or any suburb for that matter) myself before I moved there.
36,Guess who is getting a cell phone.
36,I would also like to say congrats DJS Although I don't know how I feel about you supporting Woodbury's economy in such a large way.
36,Congrats DJS Thanks for spilling the story too...
36,DJS - ENGAGED We want details Stoner and HAL - did ya find the hidden tracks
36,I may have mentioned that I wrote a song called 'Delicious Chips' for my friend in Florida to do what he'd like with it.
36,Stoner are congratulations in order Good work cement lady.
36,Guess where I'm going in February.
36,Everything old is new again... Having attended pre-school through college in this town youd think I run into people I know all the time.
36,DJS the stories we could tell about those two clowns.
36,Another story: I went to the Vikings game with Matt (a.k.a.
36,I just got the best xmas gift from my coworker As many of you know I read A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius and loved it.
36,OK Kiddies - who's working next week I am.
36,Hal I would think a serious sipper like yourself would want your latte to stay as hot as possible for as long as possible.
36,Okay so I've now located a resource to help me with the coffee-temp related questions I have First off how do you tell between a 150-degree latte and an 160-degree latte Also do you turn around and tell them to heat it up if it's unsatisfactory Or do you just let it go How do you arrive at said bevy temperature preference Do you find something too cool and put a thermometer in it for future reference Do you burn your tongue and figure that's 5 degrees too hot So many questions...
36,Okay coffee-drinkers and Duf...I finished my movie picks.
36,We walk among you... Hal I've ordered my lattes extra-hot before.
36,Disturbing new trend noted while getting my coffee this a.m. - People who specify the temperature of their coffee as part of their drink order.
36,For the Record; Stop the Presses; Yes I Really Was Panda - FYI I never betrayed you (and I'm pretty sure the cock has crowed three times) so you can throw all these Judases out and we can run our blog as we see fit :) Extra Extra Extra Read all about it - Stoner has a boyfriend All we need now are details.
36,Stoner's First Movie Review by Stoner Last night I attended the second installment in the Lord of the Rings series.
36,Duf Were you really propositioned again last night I think you may have the world's record for number of times approached by a hooker.
36,I had some really great news today Hey everyone I just found out that I am going to graduate fourth in my class from the Minnesota Academy of Pimp Arts and Sciences White Bear Lake Township Campus (Est.
36,I thought I was going to die yesterday or rather...wished I had.
36,Stoner if you die it will mark an epidemic in Pandyland as Pandy herself is surely dead.
36,Duf I appreciate you looking out for me.
36,5; Disappointed; Low Post My top five for the year (I spent all weekend thinking about it): 5.
36,If I'm dead tomorrow it's because my coworker just Lysoled the room.
36,Is everyone dead Me I'm tired.
36,I like to shake my boo-tay.
36,I think I'm with Heather...haven't had much time or money lately to keep up with the trends...but for me: Beck - Sea Change Beck is extremely bummed out.
36,DJS is way more on the cutting edge than I. I usually come around late to new stuff.
36,Since we're coming up on the end of the year why don't we start a series of BEST of 2002 lists We can do one a week until the end o' the year.
36,From the 'Yeah...We Already Know' Department...
36,My coworker just cut into a HUGE chocolate/caramel/nut-coated apple.
36,My place of employment is looking pretty sad today.
36,A few thoughts on Mariah Carey and the Today show For those who may not know Mariah Carey performed live from the Mall o America on the Today show this morning.
36,An insurance company brought lunch in for everyone today.
36,Duf is traveling for work again this week.
36,HAL I suppose you could say it was a cry for help - a cry to plan another Pandyland Jamboree maybe.
36,I can't believe I missed the offer for a free after-work bevvy.
36,Panda was Saturday night a cry for help You can tell us.
36,DJS glad to hear you saw Frida HAL heard this story first-hand but just to give y'all a quick recap: I went out with the girls on Saturday night...the same time my parents were staying at my place because they went to see an opera on Saturday in Chicago.
36,What up Pandyland A couple of you cats know I write and of those that know a couple also know that I sent my story to two kids to read and send me back a review.
36,Wow - DJS you're my favorite.
36,I have another work gripe that I need to express - font usage.
36,DJS: You is definitely my caucasian.
36,OK...now that DJS has offered up the Bono/Bjork page HAL has to put him back on the Bagel List.
36,As a peace offering I've made a link to the right.
36,Pandymonium in Pandyland Okay now wait a minute.
36,Too bad it had to come to this - DJS you're off my salt bagel list.
36,Oh yeah This is why I'm NOT friends with her.
36,DJS word of advice: don't ever challenge HAL on any piece of U2 trivia.
36,DJS I'd love to share set lists with you (seriously I would).
36,HAL: Did you see U2 perform during their Popmart/Zooropa days They may have rescinded their statement since then but I'm quite sure they boycotted performing their earlier efforts (read: their hits) for a period a while back.
36,Wow I've never seen such long posts since....oops again...wrong site.
36,I can't disagree with what people are saying here.
36,Okay...now the gloves are coming off.
36,I'm sorry I missed out on this argument yesterday but I really feel I must contribute my unbiased opinion to the Bono vs. Bjork discussion.
36,Cool so you've seen 'Rattle and Hum'.
36,Bjork...flaky Them's fightin' words I'm not trying to start a riot but it just reminded me of the 'Am I buggin' you I don't mean to bug ya.'
36,Okay...I know some of you Pandy-ites love Bono but this excerpt from an article (sent in by Moses Oatmeal) is just...plain...corny...
36,Who are you callin' a grown man Hasta la next week Ciao for now
36,'Though I think you know it the article is a scam.

36,Woo-hoo Panda is coming to Minneapolis for St. Patrick's Day Ow Half-time Rec Sounds good to me... Stoner I'm afraid of the trash dungeon too.

36,Death has warmed over; What does it mean when... A guy says he wants you to meet his parents He has already made plans with you for Valentine's day He makes you breakfast Needless to say I had a stellar weekend.
36,FYI while the article IS disturbing it's controversial because many are saying it's not quite the epidemic that Rolling Stone(r) is making it out to be.
36,On a less serious note: Here's a 'Real Fact' I got from my Diet Iced Tea Snapple cover...
36,I just read that article HAL posted from Rolling Stone.
36,Here's where I was confused: Even though it says very plainly that Duf posted at 10:31 on Thursday I thought DJS posted that hence the plea for him to read the biography.
36,Friends Let me make it plain.
36,DJS FYI: I have not even read The Fountainhead .
36,So I picked up a copy of Jack Kerouac's On the Road at the airport.
36,I always thought that 'bug juice' was mosquito repellant.
36,Look at what HAL gave me.
36,As I walked down the aisle back to my cube I caught myself whistling the 'Darth Vader' music from Star Wars.
36,Yes I'm a damn video game nerd.
36,Traveling with Panda could be hazardous to your health - I got copied on the following email today: Hey James Panda here...Paul's big sister.
36,I'm staying at Le Parker Meridien this week.
36,HAL I think that was the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
36,'In 27 years I have worn approximately 7020 pairs of socks and I have owned approximately 810 pairs of socks.'
36,Sockin' It to Ya' I have worn 9100 pair of socks in my lifetime.

36,Filled Up Senses 'landers I'm so glad Stoner is back Everyone my brother is reading the site so please no cursing and shit.
36,The Panda has spoken: The Edgeland it is.
36,Geez - a girl takes a two hour lunch and.... 1.
36,Dear Duf That would be 'You fill up my senses...' from Annie's Song (I was supposed to dance with my dad to this song at my wedding.)
36,Hal please do us the honors.
36,I Get Knocked Down but I Get Up Again/You Light Up My Senses/Judge Him By the Content of His Riffs/Echoes 'Hell yeah.'
36,Bonoland Edgeville and Larryopolis all get my vote.
36,Duf says....RELAX Panda I want 'The Edgeland' but it has to have The in front of it.
36,Pandyland is part of a democratic state.
36,Panda Bono land I'm all over it.
36,The only way you can keep that up there this week is if we can have a picture of Bono up there next week.
36,Multiple Choice Question: If you look closely at the picture above you will see Duf in the background: a. Tryin' to hail a taxi.
36,So it's pretty timely and coincidental that I just saw '25th Hour' on Sunday night: a movie about a guy facing a 7-year prison term.
36,Panda: I can't thank you enough for sending us the link to that Maddox guy.
36,Shovel Don't you mean Selma land Thanks Duf
36,I guess my first question would be: WHY
36,Would anyone be really upset if I changed the name of our blog to Salmaland just for this week I'm just trying to get a feel if people would have a problem with that.
36,Prologue: Let me start by saying that I like Pandyland best when it is madcap and silly.

36,I like to peel the skins off of oranges.
36,HAL someday I would like to hear the story about the blood all over your fridge.
36,May the records show that my previous post about Bono is nothing like my trying to understand how people are so enamored with Coldplay.
36,DJS your Coldplay comments are awful reminiscent of the Whats the deal with Bono post a few months back.
36,Okay...at the risk of being tarred and feathered I just don't get the whole Coldplay thing.
36,On the Bright Side I Won't Go Blind...
36,The Definitive Grammy's by Duf' Top three moments at the Grammy's (in order from cool to coolest): 3.

27,Day 2 of the new Hypefactor sessions were again productive and successful.
27,Since yesterday was Day 1 for the new Hypefactor material I've decided to keep an ongoing journal about this record so a year from now I can look back and see what this album eventually started as and how much it either changed or stayed on course.
27,Spent the bulk of the working on two things: 1.
27,We ventured to Brooklyn last night to check out the Sigur Ros/Bjork show.
27,As of 5 p.m. today - Saturday - there are enough guitars on 'Solar' to injure a small animal.
27,I had chosen not to post about last nights session as I felt Brandt captured it almost perfectly.
27,F.J. Ash and I had an extremely productive evening in the studio yesterday and all four or five hours of the session were dedicated to the recently-unearthed 'Solar.'
27,Brandt is a young douche who is paying $300 to see Duran Duran.

27,With Ash unable to make it last night the spotlight focused on Ms. Emmet who while brought in initially to be the aggression’s first and only drummer (and quickly became my favorite member of the aggression) has become quite the impressive guitar player in Hypefactor.
27,I'm saddened to read reports that 16 Volt have called it a day.
27,Quick Pit Stop in the studio yesterday for some bass overdubs and retracking some older parts to fit the current scheme of things.

27,Hi Ashley: After an early breakfast this morning with my old pal the famous Martial Arts Cinema historian/Author (who hated KILL BILL by the way) I decided to stroll through Times Square in search of inspiration for my mom's Birthday gift.
27,Despite my being distracted by Dan Hamill's discovery of classic wrestling on channel 70 the vision of the new Hypefactor album became significantly clearer with a whirlwind editing/arranging sessions yesterday at the Birdcage.

27,For the first time in weeks I made it down to the studio to get back to work on HF2.
27,There's a lot of HF going down right now actually.
27,Well Saintface finally had what they claim will be their last gig of 2003 (I'll believe THAT in 2 days) and it was a true test for the band in that they were plagued (and I mean PLAGUED) by technical difficulties that reminded me of the aggression's 2001 comeback gig in NYC.
27,This comes all the way from our new friend Timo who lives in Berlin who I mentioned a few posts back about having trouble getting our CD's.
27,Sorry its been so long but thats not to say there isnt anything exciting going on.
27,Been spending some time hanging out with Irene at home and working on loops for Jared's new project which I think he would describe as 'broken word'.
27,Vocal demos continued through the weekend with the heat at the studio going in and out at will.

27,Reeling from the Indy debacle (and I know quite a bit about it what the hell went down with that) Irene and I cabbed it to her fave hipster hang Piano's to check out some Saintface.
27,What a shity way to start the day.
27,The elements had to smack somebody sometime so thanks to a fever of 103 Brandt had to bow out of Saturday's drum recording which effectively killed that.
27,So Irene and I made the trek to a midtown Manhattan movie theatre to see a special preview of HELLBOY the large motion picture based on the Dark Horse Comic.

27,Though this blog is usually reserved for the musical portion of my life I must report today that I am a victim of false reporting on the internet.
27,Upon finishing the post below something was nagging at me.

27,Jesus where do I begin Last night and at long last Irene and I made the trek to Harlem to the legendary Apollo Theatre to see Morrissey take to the stage for the first time here in many years.
27,It's a lazy day in MOGworld as Irene has been downed by a mediocre 2am cheeseburger that didn't agree with her (damn you Gramercy) and I'm just flat out beat.
27,I'm still digging the Ryan Adams album immensely to the point where it's taking me time to get focused on the new Cure album.
27,I'd like to take a quick moment to announce the arrival of the newest little member of the MOGpac...Lucia Mary Magdalene Link born June 24 2004 12:36 a.m. 7 pounds 8 ounces and 52 centimeters.

27,I'm leaving shortly to go to the studio to work with B and our special guest Leo V23 who is in town for a spell and has been roped into to add even more to this album (hopefully in the form of some sharp backing vocals).
27,Matt is obviously poopy from the lack of aggression in his life so let me tell you about the Skinny Puppy shows.
27,I keep talking about how we are in the home stretch and while these songs are pretty much up to snuff and just need drum edits before mixing one song called one.nine.five.six (which I'll herein refer to as 1956) has plagued us.
27,Between an evening at the movies and a night in the studio Thursday was a good day in MOGworld.
27,Well after months of anticipation Irene and I were finally able to stay in town long enough to join MOG Athletics' Dodgeball Team for their second tournament.
27,Well hipsters I'm looking forward to seeing you at the Cure's travelling festival next month and if you see me there you can thank Mattagement because thanks to a Ticketmaster screw up the Internet Pre-Sale didn't start as scheduled and computer glitches made it EXTREMELY difficult for Dan Hamill and I to obtain our tickets this morning.
27,Obviously he's been too busy staring at the birds across the way as Brandt in his genius totally skipped over our Memorial Day session at the studio which was in fact the First Official Vocal Session (tm) of the album.
27,For the second post in a row the MOGpac heads south of the border.
27,If you weren't at Rothko's on Friday night you missed it meng.
27,There is literally never a moment of rest this month as I woke up at 4am got on a 7am plane flew to NY walked in the door kissed Irene hello ate some Pluck and then ran off to see Saintface in Brooklyn at my favourite venue Southpaw.
27,My nephew Cameron J. Bradish informs me that we must never EVER talk to the Mondu which is a korean dumpling that Irene's mom makes that is blow away the best dumpling I have ever had.
27,My LA trip is taking its toll but it does allow me a few fun moments.
27,The con was THIS close to a full success mostly because I got screwed big time out of the convention only Batman figure.
27,The Rollercoaster I am on called ComicCon continues to run me ragged.
27,Despite not being here for a few months California is just how I left it: Sunny hot and filled with the usual suspects.
27,Since all is quiet due to MOGtravel let me throw in a quick note about the Prince show I attended on Monday 7/12.
27,Well the above phrase was uttered by MOGpac Athletics team captain Matt after the Pac lost a crucial dodgeball match to the tournaments first ever (at least from what I've seen) All-Girl team and I think that sums up last nights D-ball performance.
27,First off I just love the above title which is a quote from a description of the new Jackie Chan movie NEW POLICE STORY.
27,Starting with this post I will start a new section of this blog entitled 'What I've Learned From...' in which when I feel I have learned something for better or for worse from someone.
27,Beat from what seems like a week of non stop insanity I will try to recollect the past few days to the best of my abilities.
27,Here is today's fan mail send to my hypefactor.com address: 'Rarely have I read through such a vast pile of horse manure.'
27,i'm not a fan of europe.
27,While I cannot write volumes about the KMFDM debate as I am on holiday in Praha and writing this on the clock in a 'net cafe I will say this in response to FJ's query... Sascha's comments about the making of Money are quite accurate although some of what he said in the aforementioned interview was news even to me.
27,In response to my previous post the person I called out on the H-bar board regarding KMFDM's MONEY album has responded and with factual back-up to boot.
27,A few things on my mind while I have your attention: On a late night visit to a magazine store on 3rd Ave I noticed that some 'rock' magazine called REVOLVER had not only an article on Ministry but also some kind of 'definitive' history of industrial music in.
27,The days draw near before Irene and I head to the other part of the world so the chaos is at double speed (even though I am taking the time to blog and she is on the couch watching a screener of TROY and I think slowly regretting it).
27,Taking a break from music (and having a sick girlfriend at home) I caught up on my movies while also checking out several TV pilots that you all will be watching in the Fall.
27,Sadly with a girlfriend with flu-like symptoms my planned screening of COLLATERAL didn't happen.
27,Still without any time to really take a day to rest Irene and I joined by G Lurch and Ash (who graciously provided transport) went out to the landfill known as Randall's Island to check out The Cure's CURIOSA festival.

17,tired...and grouchy...and feeling bad and apparently I am getting nailed...for sentence fragments.
17,My mentor sent me an email...which I thought was worth sharing There are so many things I wanted to say while reading your letter that it actually got me out of bed again- FIrst Its critical that you remain open-minded not let your prejudices cloud your viewpoint..especially since you have so little real exposure to other cultures in situ.. you make a number of comments very derogatory to western civilization (corrupted fake commercial) that reveals your distaste and bias against it...So before I get too far into this tell me if there is any evidence any argument possible that would dispel that belief (not that I particularly want to)- If not then you are holding your views as a religious person in which facts and rationality take a back seat to prior learning indoctrination and negative emotions.
17,I just got another email from Gordon.

17,how did we end up like this so far apart so distinct i feel like i dont even know you you were my soul mate my everything but now you've become just another voice on the line you're not mine i dont claim you its over cant you see we made it happen once before but now im done no longer do i want you i dont crave your kisses your touch because im finally done cant you see the new me the woman i've become im in search for something new something far from you someone who doesnt know me He'll get to know me deeper then you ever did then you ever tried this is my new voice stronger wiser ive learned from you but now i'm done your my past the person on the other line the person who i'm not afraid no more butterflies no more
17,do you hear it the voices from the past spoken softly in the night i hear it as the cool wind blows i hear it with a creeping chill running down my back the voices of wise the voices of old filling my head and dreams they know so much of life and death the answers to all questions all i hear is gentle whispers not to make out a word i hear it as the night is still i hear it when my eyes are closed just concentrate and stand still to make out the voice that takes me to a different world my lullaby for sleep do you hear it the voices from the past spoken softly in the night
17,lets not speak about it ever agin lets not go down that road of what we are and come to be and how it started out every beginning must have an end the cruelty of life death to us is not an option its what we'll come to face we will meet it young or old some to be too soon some with pain and some without but always alone no one to help you no one to explain what is to become a heaven paradise is what we think the pretty thoughts we made nothing is empty nothing is sad something we've never felt life is something we never have nothing until the day we die our final thoughts as breath grows slow as the heart will take its stop do you see a light or total darkness night do you see the face of god what is there for you if only these answers i could know this process wouldnt be so hard the fear of death the fear of end nothingness at all

17,What Happened To Us by Hoobastank Album : The Reason I thought it was too good to be true I found somebody who understands me Someone who would help me to get through And fill an emptiness I had inside me But you kept inside and I just denied Some things that we should have both said I knew it was too good to be true Cause I'm the only one who understands me What happened to us We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only Remember they thought we were too young To really know what it takes to make it But we had survived off what we have done So we could show them all that they're mistaken But who could have known The lies that would grow Until we could see right through them Remember they knew we were too young We still don't know what it takes to make it What happened to us We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only one We could've made it work We could've found a way We should've done our best to see another day But we kept it all inside until it was too late And now we're both alone The consequence we pay for throwing it all away For throwing it all away What happened to us We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only What happened to us What happened to us What happened to us What happened to us

16,Disclaimer: normally writings by me do actually include pronouns but not today sigh approaching my fiftieth post.
16,seeing as how they're half the weight of my PUPPY it was insanely simple to walk them with the mom today.
25,colourful displays of affection beaming with the happiness of a smile to be envied by others.
25,I want to hide away tonight with you climb into the darkness into the warmth beside you I want to hide my face from the world and feel the warmth in the dark places beside you into our cave away from everything else away from the world I want to climb into the warmth of saftey into the darkness will you come with me my love will you hide with me and hold my hand will you pet my hair and whisper giggles the warmth is so inviting beside you I feel safe with my eyes closed.
25,such a smile takes away all worry how strong hands can cup and hold so gently my face a gentle kiss melts the world away making this depression slip aside into the light some days are so horrible I know the pain that lurks within me and how it creeps taunting me with the loss of you filling me with fear that you may leave you help me fight.
25,...pulling my leash with urgency until my face is so close I can smell his scent everywhere.
25,beyond the call of gods and of heroes beyond that taste of salt on lips i feel the infinite wonder i taste what gods feel within their caves of plato what majesty is within these walls feeling the stone never to be toppled the eyes never to close out the light the infinity of darkness within these strong barriers protecting soft hands and delicate sensations from damage the will of Her that allows passage from one to another to another and then to end resolution.
25,seductive secretness behind doors warning me to never let in the silence warm air inviting sleep and quiet reflection wind moving and creating the noises that silence me strong arm protecting me from the nightmares that envelop my mind in the darkness his body warms me while his eyes consume me blessed be this place of saftey and serenity I am at peace at last with him that holds me at night.
25,For being so kind to me when I need you most; for holding my hand and petting my hair when I cry; when you bring me water and chocolate icecream; when you offer cuddles without saying a word.
25,blurry outside sounds as people mingle and pass in the darkness focus on hazel eyes filled with wonder and ... searching lips moving; mind's attention soaked with longing the background melts away bodies moving closer without moving touching without intent feeling the warmth of another's breath the past fades away I have found my heart within him I know the meaning of desire at last.
25,my body feels broken while my mind rejoices at the thought of you the warmth of a smile dulls the pain in my legs the promise of an embrace erases the sight of another hill sweaty bodies mingle in the dark warm places of the mind sleep envelopes me safe within your arms to be awoken with a slight kiss
25,transported through the air into the mall across town through the throngs of girls in pants too low and boys with gold necklaces into the shop beside the bank near the bathrooms the colour of love is present not being over-powered by the sound of elevator music and rap mixed together
25,life that has over-come the garden taking control with vibrant chaos and green-ery burnt by the sun again cut by a blade drowned again by the flood to be trampled by a foot and hand again bless-ed sweet water washing away the dirt and grime again
25,White that blankets has turned grey Quiet of the evening danger promises slick noise to be hated trudging trudging trudging sludge sludge sludge in an office building I hate with people I pity instead of the white forest quiet reflection nature instead of consumer drive shallow endeavores win over thin ice and frosted trees the spring is coming the holly king is dead the oak is reborn again i mourn the holly prince as She celebrates the rebirth both celebrations are lost on those who worship here i pity myself for my presence
25,The fire that forms The rain that cools The air that shapes delicate fleshy hand touching history cold and eternal history of persons animals the Earth the gods feeling the power within and sharing knowledge of one another leaving a part to take a part that will be shared again something small and light within my pocket; cupped within my hand; held between my fingers; thrown out into the ocean.
25,that moment comes so quickly seeing all that is to be understood I see the possibilities you help me see the present we make the outcome visable to others and myself.
25,Mighty fury drowning out the sounds of death creating life through destruction a pity that they do not understand those who cannot hear Your song whispered in the trees flowing through the river death is not punishment from Your touch but a promise of new life.
25,the strength of the sun is warming my back welcome great king sit upon Your great thrown in anticipation of the end.
25,the fury comes in bursts into the mind the eyes see the possibilty of revenge against ... torture through seeming kindness works here hours wasted but not in vain self-glory hands dirtied in the striving of perfect retaliation the rewards are sweet to the taste and eyes the ears are rewarded with praise and the pride with stiffled fury of the victim the sweetness is better then any hot meal

17,Somebody tell me Why I can't react to thoughts of separation To thoughts of death Thoughts of suicide No fear or hate A mental dusk falling Falling So many feet per second So many at once Somebody explain Why when I get close to the Grand Canyon And look over the edge Or stand on a highway shoulder and squint As a thousand suns glare past me Why do I have the urge The inside urge The unexplainable insatiable curiosity To jump Trip fall Into the earth scar or onto the asphalt Just to see what would happen Maybe I am dreaming more than my mind Enjoys now I haven't dreamt in my sleep They're making up in waking Wandering In a half-stupor Wondering which way to turn Looking from a tower upon literally Thousands of lives Striding about in self-assurance I want to fall Feel the wind pulling at my ears Though I could never plunge from High diving board Low diving board Fear of height to an extent But fear is what kept the early man alive I think I can't feel it for what matters Or maybe I don't think Maybe it's all an instinct Someone tell me Am I the only one who has These irrational fits of mood Even though No no one no psychiatrist Ever diagnosed me Perhaps its a mental disease no one Found It's been almost a day since I had a cheerful idea No nightmare No dream Just dreary reality That sucks the imagination from Everything Don't hate me Don't pity me I just want an answer Life is like insulin Hate it but can't do without it Take what you got Even if you never wanted it Somebody tell me Who I am And am I now

17,No idea where this came from... Poe doll dances around every night at precisely eleven fifty-seven pm its eyes begin to glow with the digital burn and I watch it rising out of the floor with a purple mist creating its tattered robe barely smiling through its stitched mouth it dances two feet off the floor spinning feverishly in a wide oval and the tatters fly out in a ring around it it sings with a faint wail a faint wail the cat's cry in a human throat of a little serene and faintly ominous thing and the spark on its back begins to spread leaping to its tatters and its stick hands held out like a scarecrow and then lights up the head in a blue yellow flame its eyes are burning brighter than its personal inferno the Poe doll begins to wobble its tatters are fluttering unevenly and its wail dies away the Poe doll sinks back into the floor at twelve eight am precisely the grisly cadaver of a dream I sewed its lips together and lit it on fire.

23,Few years back I met this girl who I would never understand.
23,Look whose here..ambala the man himself .. well as we all knw assi takes LSD and posts blogs.. wht happnd to baba now...
23,hey baba wht in the world was that...do expect us to read that whole shitcoz i dont think u wud hav read it urself.
23,Ahem errr...emotions are not abstract its subjective...u knw wht emotions u have towards a person..it changes with time and circumstances..(just like abstract class in JAVA) not believing in abstract metaphysical theory indicates that the person has sound logical and sense of questioning things and not go by flimsy theories which do not have a sound logical base... All of us knw that the 'truth is out there'..so y jump the gun ...we knw just 5%..we knw that we dnt knw anther 10%..wht we dnt knw is that we dnt knw abt the stuff we dnt knw is 85% ;)...
23,Critics are well wishers in disguise Hey Hash everything meta begins from something abstract...coz even emotions are abstract Few run away from what they feel is true coz they want to believe it otherwise and hoodwink themselves.But truth is something like an air packet under a water body...itz gonna come up and burst your bubble.
23,well some words of advice for Diablo and BABA ..man u guys talk so meta physical ..its so hysterically rubbish ... its more like u guys talking on a topic like 'PHYSICS OF SCIENCE' even though its crazy u can just bluff abt it and make it sound sensible ..LOL hehehe ..dnt take it personally Assi can be a good writer..he shldnt waste his talent..
23,......A PORTAL is created for everyone to commune & share their vibes...alas mortals are always tied to a materialistic bondage....commitments & expectations pull them apart from what they are destined to commit & act....for itz only after death they realize their chance has slipped...& all they have got is eternity to atone their sins....do remember life is brief but after death lies the real test
23,just for smiles Hey guys Please give due credit to Mr Rao he has this to say regarding a blog post about microsft.
23,U know Diablo every person has a aura (I mean the one that is seen around the head of great people) Now only children see this aura and when u grow up will not be able to see it.
23,Life is indeed a funny musical chair competition....the music keeps ringing in your ears ripping your tender ear membranes....for a fewLady Luck smiles & they get a seat...others keep running in the dark...banging their heads..bruising their bodies..wrecking their confidences...they just keep running hoping that the music is going to stop the next instant Alas mortals are blessed only with that...HOPE -Diablo-

23,Me and chandru when he come to banglore june-17-2004
23,Since my return from England in July more than a few of my tastes have changed.
23,...after a long day of playing Final Fantasy X-2 chatting with friends on AIM and going through adventure-gaming websites and an idea occurred to me as I pondered about making my own adventure game: why not make a Harry Potter adventure Okay so it's not really original but what irks me about the official Harry Potter games published by Electronic Arts is that a) they are painfully mediocre and b) they utilize only a tiny fraction of the possible gameplay elements offered by the Harry Potter universe.
23,...of many entries about gaming one part of the eclectic hobbies in which I spend my free time (which is all the time at the moment.
23,My blog is now searchable via the Google code at the bottom of the main page.
23,I think that having seeing all three LOTR movies and especially the extended versions of the first two before the third I got back into the feel for high fantasy.
23,I suppose it's fitting that I started this at the beginning of the new year.
23,As you may or may not know I've been taking a life/health insurance prelicensing class all week.
23,Today's insurance class was definitely better than yesterday's.
23,Today I sat in a classroom all day and learned about insurance.
23,Apparently the academic study of gaming is finally becoming mainstream.
23,I admit that I'm not the best journaler in the world.
23,So I finished Fellowship of the Rings today and it was...okay.
23,Since I have a lot of free time these days I've started watching TV again mostly specific shows like Dr. Phil Oprah CSI Gilmore Girls and Pokemon.
23,Tomorrow's God the newest installment in the Conversations with God series was released this month and I got my copy earlier than expected.
23,Yesterday I went to Blockbuster's to rent Under the Tuscan Sun which is actually a really good story about self-reliance and loving yourself before finding someone else to love.
23,I have added a 'current readings' list to the left hand column.
23,If you've seen Bowling for Columbine or read Conversations with God you know how the local news cop shows and other violent programs feed into the culture of fear in America.
23,The newest book in the Conversations with God series Tomorrow's God comes out today I ordered an authographed copy though so it'll take a few weeks to get here.
23,I just finished making naan bread for the first time and it was a success Woo Okay it doesn't quite taste like real naan but it has got chewy bready goodness.
23,I know I haven't blogged in a while -- not that I don't have stuff to say I've just been lazy (and jetlagged).
23,As I have returned to my gaming habit I decided to put up a list of the games I'm currently playing which I may or may not talk about.
23,So I went to the Renaissance Fair down here in So.
23,Blogger just keeps getting better and better these days.
23,As you may have noticed I've changed my blog template to one of the new ones offered by Blogger.
23,Yes I have more fuel for my British/Indian food cravings and all without leaving town -- that's right I got them at the Ralphs closest to my house while shopping for Mother's Day groceries this evening.
23,I mentioned googling for a (English) baked beans recipe in the last post.
23,I finally got to read Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code after waiting on my library's hold list for months (starting out as the 10th person in line).
23,Do you ever one of those 'instant revelations' where you all of a sudden understand the way some aspect of life works You usually wouldn't write it down immediately thinking you're going to remember it later -- except you don't.
23,I actually did fire up Gabriel Knight 3 again and played it through (on my new laptop; the DVD drive on my desktop has trouble installing anything these days).
23,I hadn't realized I didn't post anything for an entire month Well let's see... in July my birthday came and went.

17,Today consisted of me going to Grams for lunch getting pictures and 7 hours of soccer camp.
17,Ha I didn't originally intend for such a long post... it just kind of happened that way
17,This week seemed like one day.
17,I'm no longer here My spirit has gone Lost among the shadows Where you dare not go Still I stand before you Like the days of old Smile and wave Like nothing is wrong But watch as The lights fade And I am Floored by the sound Of the silent scream Listen to the whispers Feel the world change As I walk way Beautifully hollow
17,This is me Watching the sky This is me In the calm Before the storm.
17,Decided your leaving tomorrow So I'll say goodbye tonight No use dragging on Realized last week you were gone Already lost to world We should have won This could have lasted forever Say Good night one more time One more kiss Good-bye This time it really counts Sickening feeling Knowing I won't see you again Have to let this go Home is where the heart is Together feeling home Still can't tell when you left Now knowing your home May never been here at all
17,Time seemed to fly When you stopped by.
17,If you love something You have to let it go.
17,After its all said and done Will you still think of me Walk away feel like you've won Where will you be And what will you do After your smile fades.
17,I must break free Shake off these chains and Fly away again Caged up Anxiousness building to great For even the strongest bars to hold I won't stay down much longer Something will give And I will not falter.
17,The warm sun upon my face and a cool breeze blows Somehow I managed to win this race I found out where this road goes The morning it greets me with the sands of the beach and the sounds of the sea all within arms reach.
17,I can see the ocean I can see the sparkling waters as the waves lap peacefully on the shore I can feel the cool breeze and the warmth of you hand in mine As the sun begins to set White clouds begin to change Transforming into brightly colored ribbons Brilliant streaks of red and orange The violet night slowly creeps across the sky.
17,Hollow and empty Turn it inside out and see how deep this well goes The end of the tunnel I've yet to see Haven't heard the splash of the bottom A flash of lightning showed my path Briefest of visions Flirting with my mind Thinking I was back on track Return to the darkness I named the feeling but feeling no closer to despelling it Feeling the world a little more again Return to the ground after a brief trip to the clouds Do I work to get back to that place or do I work to make this place better Do I risk the cliff To feel like flying or do I sit still and avoid the crash
17,watch this flame beat away the darkness of my face watch as my grin widens while the flames grow feel the heat of the moment hear the beast roar smell this burning flesh it will be over before you know it the bright flames of life shall destroy themselves and the fuel that gives it power this unruly beast shall perish die into ashes grey dull and lifeless
17,Sorry I can't be the one that you wanted me to be.
17,All these clouds of grey Hide me from the sun And the rest of the beautiful day.
17,Fustrations are fueling this fire of Anger burning at my brain and scorching all emotions numbing my insides I know I have to get away Free myself from this hell step outside of the flames step outside of the world get out and away from it all Standing on the edge of my world I look into the distance and see more walls trapping me inside this shell the way out is gone remants of the path covered by the last to travel upon it trapping me in the flames the edge is near clutch it tightly in desperation or just let go and escape the flames fall beyond caring seal yourself off and vow to rot alone
17,Falling faster than before Down Down again.
17,All the things I could have said Now are running through my head.
17,The sunlight shines down Onto the land and across the sea It brightens everything it touches Everything but me My days still seem dark Even after the pain is gone Your shadow still haunts my eyes Whispering fear into my ears The sun shines down still Brighting the world It shines down on me But my heart is still dark And this night is cold I still wait for my dawn
17,Looked into your hollow eyes and saw you soul searching for some peace numb to the world nothing but a shell left lying naked and alone shivering in the snow Lost your way and you guide is long gone sleeping in the day surviving on the darkness waiting for answers for questions yet asked
17,Shoot to kill Miss by miles Watch innocence die Evil left to Live Rule by terror Light the way Fire of life Fueled by the dead Left are none But those hidden None so quick All have fallen In your path To revenge Greed takes you Into the darkness Of your hollow soul Again and Again
17,Seeing you again Makes me think of us The way we used to be The looks you gave me Fell so much in love It didn't matter how far You were always here Next to my heart Things have changed It doesn't hurt To be so far away And to see you In the arms of another Watched you walk in Said Hello again To my ex-lover And my new friend
17,Come stand with me Barefoot in the wet grass We can listen to the rain And watch the storm blow over Lightning lights the sky Take my hand As the rain comes down Smile just because you're here And everything seems right Retreat to the back porch Relax on the swing Spend time well earned And talk about nothings I'm leaving soon But this moment is perfect Nothing matters Except that you're with me The night fades away Sunshine brightens a sleeping face Never found the words To tell how much I care Just one more Kiss Good-bye Knowing its not Its only 'til next time
17,Unexpected endings to Stories left untold Contemplate the outcomes Of choices never made Soaring high above Flying free of sorrow Greeting the new day As we bid farewell.
15,It is an art to hide.

15,Catch me as I fall Say you're here and it's all over now Speaking to the atmosphere No one's here and I fall into myself This truth drives me Into madness I know I can stop the pain If I will it all away [Chorus] Don't turn away (Don't give in to the pain) Don't try to hide (Though they're screaming your name) Don't close your eyes (God knows what lies behind them) Don't turn out the light (Never sleep never die) I'm frightened by what I see But somehow I know That there's much more to come Immobilized by my fear And soon to be Blinded by tears I can stop the pain If I will it all away [Chorus] Fallen angels at my feet Whispered voices at my ear Death before my eyes Lying next to me I fear She beckons me Shall I give in Upon my end shall I begin Forsaking all I've fallen for I rise to meet my end [Chorus]

27,I'm back from my busy weekend =) Saturday: On Saturday morning my brother called telling us that they're in the hospital & asked if we can get there soon because Mel was already dilated at 9 sonometers (usually 10 sonometers is when birth occurs).
27,hello ya'll thank goodness the weekend is here yesterday was my coworker's last day at work.
27,So I've been going back and forth to visit my dad at the hospital everyday.
27,This will probably sound weird but I miss Andy.
24,Alright now please understand that firstly i am just a human being a little boy a single life in the big real world.
24,One thing i got to tell you are that if you ever wonder why i set the heading of this blog in this way well let me explain.
24,Of all things everything have a beginnning and an ending.
24,well well well what have i got here... a decent website provided by Google.com.
26,This is the coolest thing I just figured out how to get the blogger shortcut on my google toolbar Now I can blog at the touch of a button O' the joys of technology
26,Well it was Brents going away bash this past weekend It was great fun The padres kicked in for food and beer...they got not only 1 keg of the glorious C- but 2 It was awesome And you would think that 2 kegs would be too much but not for this group of partiers We pretty much finished both I couldn't believe it And I have to say that Jay and I kicked ass at Beirut We were the first team to take Brent and Matt to sudden death overtime O' yeah baby We didn't quite get the big W but we gave them a run for their money The night came to a close with of course.....the hot tub Its amazing how we always end up in th hot tub at 3 in the morning and why we think that is normal I don't know LOL The next morning we were all feeling pretty chipper.
26,Well I think its time to go home.
26,Did I mention that work sucks Just in case I did'nt.........work sucks.
26,So i rode my hog a la GT I-Drive style on over to the old Mackay house to see what the fellers were up to.
26,Well E3 is over and it was awesome.
26,Ok so I have checked out the Redondo police report and the Beach Reporter crime watch report and no such arrest of an irate man that was rear-ended and arrested on Saturday May 8.....This is not complete proof that it did not happen.....But I am smelling a big hunk of bullshit If Cory can actually find an arrest record I might be convinced but otherwise the smell continues to permeate
26,All I have to say is that I HATE Windows XP My employer (and IT department whom I've spoken with about 30 times over the past 3 days) for some reason thinks that this 'operating platform' is God's gift or something.
26,So we have plans to go to the beach on Saturday afternoon with the infamous k-dog...I am thinking.....he is really making efforts to redeem himself..this is a good thing.
26,Whew almost an hour later and I finally can post up to this blog.
26,E3 is coming up this week and I cant wait There are going to be tons of new games and things to see.
26,Well its been pretty hard ot keep up with the blogger lately.
26,So we just got back from a weekend of motorcycle mania.
17,I went to the store today needing to buy some ink refills for my pen.
17,I have an idea...this may sound crazy...but...why don't we start with one topic instead of everything Yeah Wrap your head around that one...
17,how about homosexuality....women in leadership...lords supper......hymns or choruses....announcements before or after the worship service....can a christian cuss......can a christian listen to secular music....should a church teach only its doctrine....does satan exist....are we predestined.....is the scripture perfect....are the gospels accurate....did jesus really raise from the dead....what about the jews.....what should we do with leviticus....where did abraham and moses go when they died.....what makes a person saved....are their modern day prophets....should speaking in tongues still be used by the church....which is more important....music or preaching or communion....why is there so much paul in the bible and so little peter and james....what should constitute church membership...how are we supposed to witness to others......how are we to explain that jesus is the only way.....should there be televangelists.....is there an absolute truth......is the god of the koran...the same as the god of the bible.....why did judas betray jesus.....was he controlled by satan.....why were their giants in the promised land....the scriptures say that angles mated with human women...i don't buy it..... well...thats enough for right now... Ryan
17,Let's cover a lot of these issues.
17,Guilt I only feel guilt when I sin.
17,on another issue all together....guilt...what about guilt....what place does it play in my life....should all christians feel guilty after watching the passion....or after going to church on sunday morning....or just reading the bible.....is there such a thing as too much guilt....maybe.....maybe not.....I know that for a long time I had a lot of guilt about a lot of stuff and I prayed for God to help me with my problems...but it didn't seem like it helpled all too much...so is God not powerful enough to help me...or am I too weak to help myself....or a combination of both....I don't think guilt should lead to a loss of faith....thats a bad deal.... Of course we should feel guilty about watching our savior be crucified.
17,so...it seems that I am the minority on this one....hmm...didn't expect that to happen at all....I always assumed that those i taught when take on my viewpoints...not saying that its a bad thing...actually i am quite happy that there is disagreement here...makes things much more interesting and it challenges me in my faith...we have to be challenged more...i think that christians try too hard sometimes to try and be nice....'thats whats wrong with you people....you just walk out when things get tough....you don't stay and fight....'....well let me tell you....I will stay and fight... on another issue all together....guilt...what about guilt....what place does it play in my life....should all christians feel guilty after watching the passion....or after going to church on sunday morning....or just reading the bible.....is there such a thing as too much guilt....maybe.....maybe not.....I know that for a long time I had a lot of guilt about a lot of stuff and I prayed for God to help me with my problems...but it didn't seem like it helpled all too much...so is God not powerful enough to help me...or am I too weak to help myself....or a combination of both....I don't think guilt should lead to a loss of faith....thats a bad deal....
17,I'd think that masturbating is a better alternative than to be sexually impure with another person.
17,Lusting is way too hard not to do.
17,I wish I had sexy problems.
17,So yesterday we had to give this presentation about the Christian subculture and how it has handled the topic of sexuality...for some odd reason we got talking about masturbation...and I ....being the strong minded person that I am....and willing to stir the pot a little...said that I don't think its that bigga deal....as long as it doesn't dominate ones life....of course....i was not met with much enthusiasm....many were offended about what i had to say...it felt like they were going to lynch me.....but....i don't think its a very black and white issue....sure there is lusting involved...and that has to somehow fall under the category of sexual immorality...well maybe not....be i am going to assume...but is it better for a teenage boy to sit in class and look at pretty girls and not think about the subject.....or is it better for him to masturbate....get that out of his mind and move on.....then maybe he can think clearly about God and his faith.....it just seems more beneficial in the long run...i am prolly wrong here....someone enlighten me.... Ryan
17,I just read the last chapter of Messy Spirituality again.
17,I know....sometimes I wonder just why we are equipped for doing some much harm...I guess it makes it that much harder to be holy...sometimes i wonder if we can really attain holiness....not just for a minute or two...but for entire days....like going without sinning for a couple weeks or something.....i hope that its true....because if there isn't a possibility of true holiness then i am sunk....and we are sunk as humans...I am not willing to believe that I cannot be perfect somehow....i guess cause thats i am always a humanist....i have been given enough ability to seek after God....if that ability disappears i think that we are no longer human.....sin is tough.....i haven't found a way to beat it yet....seek ye first the kingdom of God....and all things we will be added unto you......i can't help but think of the prayer that a man says after Jesus healed him 'Lord I believe.....help my unbelief....'......thats all I can hope for Ryan
17,God come back here I feel that I am too far away from God to get back.
17,And so we pray easy prayers and mistake them for mature prayers - “God if it’s your will please heal so and so.
17,We all have friends who we think aren't going on the right path...
17,I think that this is going to be a great thing for the youth group.
17,I always find it interesting how in my own life I can be perfectly happy with how my life is going only to have some random event shake me to the core.
17,I am beginning to understand that faith is not the way around pain it is the way through pain.
17,Hey guys...now I feel all special that I have been included in this great inner circle that y'all have been apart of lately.
17,I think it's very important to remember that it is one of many sins.
17,So today I got the new YM that the company insists on sending me although I did not pay for it.
17,I found this article today and I thought it was thought provoking...lets hear what you all think.
17,Do you know how hard it is to get somebody into church that doesn't believe in God I do.
17,We should admit we're broken... because when I feel judged by a Christian of all people it is the worst feeling in the world.
17,At Vespers last nite we had the opportunity to hear a wonderful message by a freshman here at the college.
17,Have you ever really needed to talk to someone but you haven't been able to come up with the right words to say.
17,I think that you've handled it absolutely perfectly.
17,Why is it so hard to talk to people about God I am a Christian and I know that every chance that I get I should talk about him but I know that I am not the perfect Christian so I feel like I cant talk about him.
17,What really bothers me is people say they don't have time for God.
17,You know what I get sick of....well...actually a whole lotta stuff....God did give me a critical spirt....I have to use it...but anyway...back to this specific instance of agitation...I really don't like how Christians do their best to try and not be controversial...we don't talk about politics..we don't discuss the latest news...we don't discuss the holes that exist in the bible...we don't go out on a limb and say things that might .....just might....make a whole lotta sense... everyone is in the same boat.....i have realized that a lot of christians think that church...the instituion...not just our church... is not doing a good job...but no one says anything...for two reasons....one....the same people who think there are a whole lot problems don't have any solutions....or two....they know the problems and have a good guess at solutions...but are too scared to vocalize their beliefs because they are scared what the other people in the room will think about them... give you an example...I was at this convention and we were supposed to break up in groups of five or six and do some dumb exercise that was really just an excuse for the speaker to go pee...and I was talking with this group of three youth workers from seattlle who were starting this new ministry...we were talking about effective ways to minister...and I said that maybe the best solution is to not come into ministry thinking we have all the answers...that maybe Christianity doesn't answer all life's question...btw...i am a little reluctant to write this on this blog...so don't tell anybody....anyway...these three folks from Seattle looked at me like I was the anti-Christ.....later we were told to pray in those groups about our ministries...I was thinking the whole time that I was praying out loud that those three people must think that God doesn't even listen to my prayers.... the worst kind of judgement is silent judgement...if you are gonna think that I am a heretic at least tell it to my face...instead of going back to your regular group and telling a story about this crazy extremist you met at a youth convention... alright...rant ended...
17,On my way to church yesterday I began to reflect on what Megan wrote about her friends.
17,I know there are some people who are turned off to God no matter what.
17,You know it seems that there are just some folks out there that don't get it...that will never get it....like God has really hardened their hearts....it seems so stupid...but I don't know if Christ came to save everyone...whenver he took the cup at the Last Supper he said 'this blood is shed for many for the remission of sin' notice that he didn't say everyone.
17,I'm getting lonely sitting here bored realizing it's 1 pm on a Sunday and I bet a lot of people at the FBC are having lots of fun... Robb Where are you when I need to use you for a ride ...I kid I kid... By the way I was kind of 'sadded out' when a guy from the youth group came up to me the other day.
17,I think Katie is right on with her advice.
17,By the way I am having a graduation party at my house on May 23rd... at 4 pm... if anyone wants to come... my mom is a freak and has lots of food for everyone...
17,Abercrombie and Fitch put pictures of naked people on their bags when you get stuff from a store.
17,So...tonite was my last night ever at a Greenville College chapel type event...now let me tell you...that is an odd odd thing...I was taken aback not because of the music or the atmosphere...but the fact that its over....no more of the same stuff for the last four years...time for me to grow up and face the world and all that garbage.. (begin rant) you know what I am sick of...the christian subculture...I am absolutely sick of how restrictive it is...we have a christian book store on campus..actually about fifty feet from apartment...there is this little poster in the window of this store that says 'EXPERIENCE THE PASSION HERE'....what in the world does all that crap mean....I don't what to be crucified...I read the book...why in the world would someone want to experience that.... what really got me is....all the crap that this bookstore has about the passion....there are books and cds and necklaces...necklaces for goodness sakes...these people are exploiting the death of my messiah...the savior of the world has been reduced to a fake nail hanging on a piece of leather around some thirteen year old kid in the midwest...and we are fine with that...because its at least not a hemp necklace or something....
17,Be thou my vision O Lord of my heart Naught be all else to me save that thou art Thou my best thought by day or by night Waking or sleeping thy presence my light.
17,I don't know what's wrong but lately I haven't even been able to concentrate enough on praying to do it for just a few minutes.
17,no ranting today...just to let everyone know that will we be going through the daily office of common prayer around 6:30 to prepare for worship tomorrow...so everyone be there early if you can..
17,So I was at church Sunday and I was having one of those day that I didn't want to be there.
17,Brian D. McLaren: Despite our sincerity and best of motives preachers like me mess people up.
17,So....I was thinking about what Katie was saying when her friends told her that mean girls was perverted and that she shouldn't go to see it....how dumb is that...seriously...I actually saw Mean Girls on Saturday with Jacqueline and we both enjoyed it...I mean sure...it wasn't a kid movie...but it is not supposed to be...I think it did a good job of portraying high school...at least when I was in high school...I just hate this whole idea of...if a movie has bad language or a little nudity..then it can't be a good movie....
17,At first I had no idea how it worked...but there's the trusty ol' View Blog button up there.
17,so..looks like all this blogger business is different now...I changed the template...hope you guys like it...look for more changes soon...
17,Tomorrow is my last day of being able to come and see you guys (on a regular basis) and I just wanted to thank you all for how much of a difference each and everyone of you has made on my life.
17,Hey Yall Most of yall know my birthday is on Fathers Day but what i am going to do is have it probably on the 25th of June at my house But I havent decided on having it here with yall and some more peeps or getting a dance hall and getting a DJ Tell me wat you want MY HOUSE or HALL One thing i really need to say is i need your prayers for my father Mike He is going to have surgery again on his back which the doctor only gives him a 40-60% chance of feeling up and running around the block So please pray for him and all my family Thanks Amanda P.S.
17,This idea that Jesus descended into Hell was found in one of the extra biblical materials...it was quite popular during the members of the early church...but was later left out our canon of scripture...there also is some alluding to this idea in the New Testament... For Christ died for sins once for all the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to God.
17,All right I'm new to this...
17,The idea wasn't to go and apologize to every single person you've wronged.
17,I was thinking about Robb's post...which I do from time to time...and I was thinking about confessions...and what that really means...its a pretty involved type process...I mean in the situation that Robb's lays out involves a lot of work....you have to apologize to God and a whole buncha ppl...that is kinda crappy...I think the more appropriate response would be to not do something stupid in front of a whole bunch of people...but I guess if you are on crack...then those things just tend to happen...
17,I was driving home tonight thinking to myself about something that has been bothering me for some time...and I just came to the quick conclusion that I really can't do much by myself.
17,I'm thinking the problem with me is that I know I have grace.
17,so...let me give everyone a little history on this hand raising business....as far as I can tell it has been going on for quite sometime...there was actually a strong movement among puritans in New England during the colonial days of people getting very animated with their worship...there was this group called the shakers that danced around and shook...obviously...but this strand of worship has had a place in christianity for a long long time.... now...fast forward a couple hundred years....there have been certain denominations that have always been very expressive in their worship...pentecostals are the ones that get the most notoriety for being very boisterous...some of them speak in tongues....the black churches are usually the same way....now a lot of this was very localized.....only certain denominations...but in the last twenty or thirty years came the advent of praise and worship music....before that there were just hymns.... now you have a whole plethora of songs....lord i lift your name on high....open the eyes of my heart lord....etc...etc....so....these songs are light on lyrics but heavy on a good melody....so...heres my postualte as to why so many people raise their hands.... first...these praise and worship choruses are very chant-ish....if thats even a word.....like open the eyes of my heart...you say the word holy...12 times in a row...lets face it folks...thats chanting...so...in doing that puts some people in sort of a trance like state...where things just happen....possibly somewhere this state someone was led to hold up their hands...someone else saw it....and all of a sudden...its like the mainstream thing to do.... now....i have no problems with this hand holding up thing...in general principle...but i do think that it can be dangerous....one has to be careful to think if they are doing it for what other ppl will think when they see them with their hands held up...'eww...they must be more spiritual....because they have their hand up...' type thing.....also...it shouldn't be contrived...i know of one person at Greenville who would put his hand up as soon as the first chord was played of any song....i am not one to judge...but it seems a little planned and routine... so....enough on that subject...hope that wasn't too convoluted...
17,All right when I'm at a concert with a lot of Christian bands... or... well... at church I see people with their eyes closed and their hands up apparently feeling the light or touch or something to the effect of our Lord and I can't help but feel like nothing like that will ever happen to me... is it normal Do people do it because they can't control their body and something is telling them to or do they just do it because of something else that I'm not aware of...
17,We were talking about atheists and where they go after they die and I said 'Well with you would you believe that they wouldn't necessarily go to the Hell with burning flames and 5000 degree hot tubs and such' and he said 'Are you talking about Dante's Inferno Limbo Purgatory and all of that junk' I nodded and he replied 'Didn't that idea fade out with most of the Catholics' So it's obvious that he's not a practicing Catholic or anything but it still made me curious on the basic 'rules' for being a Catholic.
17,I began work this past week in the factory...and needless to say I have met some very colorful characters.
17,There's a good chance that many of you don't know a Christian singer named Carmen but I assure you that he was pretty big within the Christian community ten or so years ago.
17,I haven't checked this in a few days but I'm glad it's being written on again.
17,I was wondering what I could talk about at the Music Fest and you guys just gave me a great idea.
17,Knowing exactly what's wrong with you and not being able to/wanting to change it.
17,Well...I'm not really sure if anyone has anything to say...I just wanted to get on here real quick that I miss all of you.
17,I was reading this book by Tony Jones today about Post Modernity and there was a section on evangelism.
17,Things here are really boring...and honestly all I do is sit around and miss Galion.
17,I am finding tonight as I sit in my hoose with nothing to do...eh that I miss you guys very much.
17,I just erased everything I typed...story of my life...I had something that I was really proud of...noticed that I didn't put a question mark in where there was one needed so I hit the Back button and it's all gone and now the title of my post is very misleading because it has nothing to do with what I'm writing...
25,Blah I hate the winter I know hate is a really strong sentiment but I've come to the conclusion that I definitely hate the winter and snow and slush and frozen cars and frozen doors and salt that ruins my car etc....etc....
25,2004 has begun and this promises to be a year of many many changes for me.
25,So I'm on probation at work.
25,Last night my celly rang and rang and rang.
25,Today was another snow day The thing about snow days is that they start off great because you experience that initial excitement of knowing you're going to get away with staying at home doing nothing all day.

24,Well not exactly 2 years 51 weeks I know.
24,I've had this blog for only a week now and I'm already slacking with my posts.
24,Recently I came across a mix CD that somehow got thrown in a box of my desk stuff.
24,So as I said in one of my posts before I am a first time home owner.
24,I ended the previous post thinking I was going to run some errands and then come back to finish later.
24,So my first attempt to link to something failed.
24,I'm not quite sure how this whole weblog thing works so bear with me.
24,I think I jinxed myself when I made the comment about getting better about posting more often.
24,I'm getting good at this posting every other day thing.
24,(That 'Argh' is my lame attempt at a pirate sound) Yesterday we had an 'optional' event in Criminal Law.
24,Here I am 8-something a.m. on Sunday wishing I was still asleep.

24,This is probably a little premature but I've been thinking lately about my plans for next summer.
24,Someone sent me a link to this website that after a series of questions proposes your 'best place to live work and retire.'
24,All of that time spent on Res Ipsa Loquitor for nothing.

24,Have you ever actually paid attention to the word suggestions in Spell Check Since I have nothing to do this morning (I love to tell myself that) I actually paid attention.

24,It took me almost five days to get motivated enough to post my thoughts about ending my first week of exams.
24,Is that what everyone does after taking their first law school exam I would like to think so since that is certainly how I felt yesterday.
24,We received an email a few days ago from one of the deans here on campus.
24,You would think that with my first final exam week approaching so very rapidly I would have lots and lots of things about which I'd be motivated to write.
24,What on earth is going on with my counter Last week I checked (yes even though I didn't post...shame on me) and the counter said around 1100 hits.

17,These are the Good Old Days These days nostalgia is lost on me I live for now instead of what will be Too happy to look back on yesterday I wish we could stay forever this way Such beautiful moments go by too fast Seconds minutes and hours slip past Until all are gone; the day will end Knowing tomorrow you'll still be my friend Together up to the stars we gaze Singing 'These are the good old days' When I'm with you I'm never judged I'm beside you when my makeups smudged My hairs in a mess and my jeans are torn Others look at me to frown and scorn But you stand by and hold my hand I can always count on you to understand But the sand keeps falling in the hour glass And what is now too soon will pass Years will speed by leaving us in a daze But we'll be singing 'These are the good old days' The time of our parting draws on apace So I'll smile with you and save your place Forever if need be until you come home From wherever it is you've chosen to roam And though these tears may fall from my eyes I always knew we'd have to say our goodbyes I have no regrets though it hurts me so To look back on so long ago So one last time under the sun's warm rays We'll be singing 'These are the good old days' Page I love you I'll miss not have you at school.
17,Today was a sad day for me.
17,Well camp is over I'm done apartment watching and Seton Fest is over and done with.
17,Let me tell you a little story.
17,Well I'm back and I can say that my fears were completely unfounded.
17,Each year I write a letter to Jared my friend who passed away two years ago today.
17,So the other day I found one of my Old Chicken Soups for the Teenage Soul books (#2 to be exact) and I read a list entitled 'What I Wish I'd Known Sooner.'
17,Every time I see the midnight sky And the crescent moon shinning high above me With the stars shimmering their precious light Whenever the day becomes the night I'll think of you.
17,You broke my heart you made me cry Without even giving me a try.
17,I look into this distorted glass A cruel image comes back to me And it breaks me more than I do it When I see the face I hate to see But now I'm caught inside that glass Trapped with the spirits of dignity And the ghosts of my self-esteem Can I live in anonymity Or must I face the world this way Must I stay and face rejection Or can I just stare into the broken glass At my reflections of imperfection.
17,While in school my mind does roam To a place where Dragons have a home Where Princes and Princess doth dwell And Faeries speak secrets I dare not tell Where water flows so deep and dark And trees reach skyward with twisting bark Where mountains stand so steep and tall And Mermaids swim by a waterfall Who knows where my mind may reach When my teacher starts to teach
17,My heart it was so lonely I thought it would beat for him only Thought the storm would never fade away Looking to the times of yesterday All hope was nearly lost No getting through no matter the cost Then like a rainbow through the clouds Spoke to me the most heavenly of sounds My soul you lifted Made me feel gifted Restored my hope and love You were sent from above Baby you chased my clouds away And opened the sky for a bright new day With you by my side I can touch the sky Kissing all my worries and fears goodbye
17,In daylight we are children holding our mothers' hands In nighttime we are Bohiemiens traveling in our gypsy band The day can get so boring of school we often tire While waiting for the night to come so we can dance beside the fire With rings on our fingers and bells on our toes We sing to the moon where ever she goes The violin plays quickly by the fire's light The wise owl takes in the sight Of our scarves waving through the air As we stick flowers in our hair By day we sit patiently waiting for the night And when the sun begins to fade we're gypsies by twilight
17,Gentle kisses reach my lips no longer Tender touches feel my skin no more My heart is aching for you to be with me I cannot hide this feeling anymore It hurts me thinking of my life without you My world is falling crashing to the ground Thunder rolls as I wait for you in vain It's clear to me now you're no longer mine Sweet whispers find my ear no longer Silent love enters my heart no more How... can this be I loved you... and you loved me I lie in bed each night calling out your name I wake every morning reaching for you I live each day wishing you were here I want... gentle kisses tender touches sweet whispers and silent 'I love you's'
17,Sweet dreams Good night Whisper softly 'Put out the light' Warm lips Love erased Fade away Warmth's replaced Cold ice Visions gone And its hours until the dawn Red roses Candle stick Melt away Burnt out the wick Salty tears Broken glass The love we had is lost Collapse Pained screams Star watch Fall away Drunk half the scotch Bruised cheek Kisses sweet Lost words when fist and face meet Sadistic devotion Amorous hate Waste away but it's too late.
17,I don't believe in love It's fairy tale that never comes true.
17,It's been many years now locked in this prison of a home A hell with bay windows and patio doors I've watch as the wishes of those I love whither at your feet.
17,I fell in love the last time it rained Mysteries of life at last explained All illusions of a girl As truth's lies unfurl I find myself lost in a dark deep sea Looking toward what is meant to be Tangled in this game of pretend Deceit and sincerity never end Only dreams to be told Deep in the nights cold Ghosts of all the could've beens' Where lies end and truth begins I fell in love the last time it rained Mysteries of life at last explained All illusions of a girl As truth's lies unfurl You shielded me from all the pains And I still see you when it rains
17,You pass me by you see me stare Your eyes see a hate that isn't there.
17,I walk along the fading line Between reality and dreams.
17,When I was a child I never was told This world was so wild unruly and cold But tragedy never collided this close to my heart Until Jared decided to tear my life apart Its something that comes to all but me Until I heard the drums of my destiny The light of his candle had been blown away A death I couldn't handle so I started to pray 'God help the people who've wandered afar For they are the people whom hate did scar.'
17,I walk these cold streets These streets I've walked with you What's left is a memory Of dirty alleys and a dismal view Somehow it looks so different From the road I've walked before It's just how I remember Except you're not with me anymore I struggle to see the stars Through the billowing clouds of haze You gave the stars their fire The same way you set my heart ablaze It seems like only minutes Since your candle's been blown out Leaving me in wanting And now I must live on without Without you I still see you Locking me in your embrace Always the romantic one With a tragically handsome face Now I'm left in wonder Marveling at love and life and death How life ends so quickly But love continues without a breath What is left; I bring along A memory of love without a frame It's just a jaded portrait Of a tender face without a name
17,You smile across the room and I know that I love you But you don't smile at me; I know I cannot have you What a merciless torment; when I see you everyday Wanting to touch you to love you in every way A million and one scenarios dancing through my mind Of your lips; a tender kiss our hearts and souls entwined But each glance is like heartbreak when you look but never see The love my heart holds for you the wreck you've made of me Against all reason and right judgment I'm sure I love just you And it tears me up inside because now I know I cannot have you So leave me to wallow in all the pain you've made And I will just continue on and live this masquerade I really need to wash away all these fantasies and dreams Because what lies beneath the surface is never what it seems In some ways I've always known you were out of reach But there's something about my heart I could never teach And you'll never know the passion and love that you missed The devotion that I've felt for you an infatuation I can't resist It seemed so easy at first; without you I still loved you But it's so complicated now; I know I cannot have you
17,Do you see what your eyes cannot My heart speaks the words my lips do not.
17,I blow out a candle I lit it for you I watch the smoke rising And wind my fingers through Its beauty strikes me It breaks my heart in two I remember your face I think of the candle as you And the flame is your life Which out yourself you blew As I watch that smoke ascend I feel like I am with you The smoke of the candle Will meet with you too...
17,I lie in our bed and wait for the dawn I haven't be the same since you've gone My hand reaches out to touch your face But your not there; it's just empty space I cry and I wonder with a weary heart Do you think of me when we're apart I want to say I hate you and I do But it's leveled by my love for you Wish I could say I'm battered and bruised That I was rejected neglected and used But I can't; it's not true I'll still be in love with you Wish I could say I'm better without you here That I lived in misery desolation and fear But I can't; what can I do I just want to get over you I walk alone beneath the pouring rain You've gone and left me with this pain I feel exposed when you're not around But when you're here my loves profound My clothes are wet; they're soaking though I want to know if I'll survive without you I want to say I'm glad that you left me But I still love you; why can't you see Wish I could say you've cheated and lied That you've been deceitful; that you denied But I can't; I always knew I was born to love just you Wish I could say since you left I haven't cried But the truth is that without you I die inside Oh yes; it's so true I'll always be in love with you
17,Why can't I just break though your walls And find out who you really are.
17,Like an echo from my past You step through the door Oh so eager to start again To turn me into your whore It's all been done before This emotional beating That's just the game you like To play; of history repeating I've broken free from you before By loosing your hold And even in doing so The thought has made me cold I had learned to live with you When all happiness is fleeting And now your back to your Old game; of history repeating But now it's time to break the cycle This cycle that’s breaking my heart But now I see that the only time I'm happy Is whenever we're apart Because I'm sick of all the shit you pull All the lying threats and cheating It looks like I won your Stupid game; of history repeating
17,I'm so sick of us being like this You feel nothing unless we kiss You just stand there and bite your lip What the hell is wrong with our relationship Screw the rhymes Tetrameters bore me I 'm just going tell you the truth Because I'm tired of being someone else I'm tired of lying to myself And sorry for lying to you The truth is I hate red roses And to me violets seem purple Isn't that why they call them violets And as for sugar; it's not always sweet Like me I like to play dress up once-in-awhile But these heels are killing me And I never sit right in a skirt While I'm at it I might as well Come clean I use unscented soup in the shower Who likes the smell of papaya and kiwi anyway If it was up to me I’d cut my nails short And throw out the polish It's a pain in the ass to paint over chips I guess you could call me humble Because I'd rather be outside Than in the mall And I'm not the type of girl who crushes on every guy But you're special I've never been the romantic type But since I've met you Love songs make sense And I must admit; as embarrassing as it is Each night I spray your brand of cologne On my pillow Because it reminds me of you So look at me without the make-up And my hair part wavy; part straight Can you love me as I am I know it's unfair To you and to me For me to continue with this stupid façade I know that I love you So I'm leaving the decision to you Love me or break me I know myself well enough to take the news And continue on No matter what the answer
17,It's Graduation day today When summer ends you'll be on your way It's hard to believe it's gone so fast And all of our memories fall into the past It amazes me to think of next year Going to classes without having you near Things won't be the same without you around And I can't let go of the friendship I've found So laugh with me; don't say goodbye Let's stop searching for answers to why Time moves slow when it should go fast But speeds so quickly to the day I'll see you last Could we have just one more year Perhaps we could stay forever here Because the future is blurry; it scares me to see What life has in store for you and for me So hit the breaks for a moment; ease up off the gas Because I don't wanna spend life looking to the past Let's wait for a moment and take it all in If we can't then this is a race I don't want to win I've got all I need with you at my side So slow down a little; let's try to decide How we can stretch these moments on And try to stop the approaching dawn But in the end; life goes on And one of these days I know you'll be gone All I can say is on that day When you leave me to find your way On your own; wherever you roam I hope you always find your way home And there I'll be waiting for you my friend Just because we're apart doesn't mean this has to end.
26,So I was in a gas station pisser the other day when I looked at the wall and noticed that someone had taken the time to carve 'Jesus loves you' into the wall.
26,So I have come to the conclusion that today's songwriters have no real creativity.
26,So I was in the same bathroom as mentioned in the first posting and noticed that someone had creatively edited the grafiti that said 'the Lord is strong here' into saying 'the ODOR is strong here.'
26,Anyone who might cross this sight really needs to go to this link.
26,Yeah tony I've got your link envy right here.
26,Okay so here's my question... Why am I not on the list of people who have met Tony It seems to me that the person who had to share a house with him growing up should get a little more of a mention than just my little side-bar that no one even reads.
26,So what exactly does that mean Ever since Tony started this site his photo gallery has said 'coming eventually.'
26,So after hearing about Pat Tillman's death I reflected my reaction to 9/11 and the emergence of a war with Iraq.
26,So Tony was lamenting a few weeks ago that he couldn't make a perfect omelet.
26,Yes I made a grammatical error in my last post.
26,So I wake up this mortning after yesterday being so nice outside and nothing much on my schedule.
26,So evidently several of the employees of a large grocery store in Bowling Green Ohio have differing opinions on the subject of religion and have taken it upon themselves to wage war on using the wall of the men's room as a battlefield.
26,All I can say is that she is beautiful and that her mother (my wife) came through like a champ.
26,I think that if Tony has yet to put a photo gallery on his site he should remove the link to said gallery.

16,Who else is sick of this pollitically correct bullshit I AM In my previous blog I moan about how the girl prayed in maori before we ate... guess what i just found out Its LEGAL (or so i am told) It is legal for MAORI prayers to be said in school but not other religions...why is that Because otherwise it would be RACIST to put a halt to there culture They are seriously pushing the boundries a mile ahead of what is basic pollitical correctness and reverse racism You know what i mean right Giving a certain race benifits because they are scared of being accused of RACISMI mean what next...I wouldn't be suprised if next thing you know it will be legal for maoris to eat their neighbours I mean it is part of there culture right So who are we to stop it I tell you who We are the people who civilised these savages...they wouldnt exist if it wasnt for us contributing races...now I know this isn't entirely pollitically correct but i dont care.

16,Wow....I have NOTHING to write....bloop bloop bloop...I guess its the boredem...cant think when bored...its like at school when they expect you to write a speech hence the word SPEECH yet dont let you speak...its fucking hard to do in silence.

25,I wish I didn't have to work.
25,I didn't write anythong to be grateful for last night because quite frankly I didn't feel like I HAD anything to be grateful for.
25,Sitting on the bus today I passed some fly posters with the words 'Shout GOURANGA Be Happy' on them.
25,I didn't do an entry last night for a couple of reasons...
25,Well I say lighter it's mainly just my three things to be grateful for tho my fish tank is looking less cloudy and I had a good day at work.
25,I was reading the local paper in my lunch half-hour today just flicking through really to while away the minutes until I could go back to doing my job (because it's such an exciting and invigorating job).
25,Well here I am again trying a different site for my online journal.
25,I realised that though I write a lot of stuff on here many of you won't know a hell of a lot of details about me as a person.
25,I'm not feeling so good today.
25,I feel a bit of a bitch.
25,::::Grins::::: Well I don't know what that was for but I like it.
25,I have come to the conclusion that fish are not very bright at all.
25,My regular readers may be wondering where I was yesterday.
25,Lovely weather we're having for october.
25,I'm feeling a little better now.
25,I am in need of a hug.
25,Some one said something last night in sci fi chat.
25,Why Just because I like them.
25,As you might have guessed I've just been to see HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
25,I went in Burger King for my lunch today seeing as I was down town buying stuff.
25,:::sigh::: I'm not happy and I don't know why.

23,you know that feeling when your eyes are heaviest and you know you're about to fall asleep any minute i've been feeling that for hours before actually falling asleep now...and then i wake up 1-2 hours later and repeat...
23,dreams again... and dreams where earlier parts of dreams were just dreams...
23,if i put the time it took me to take the IQ test into the form rather than leaving it blank and letting it assume the full 13 minutes my IQ jumps to 149
23,It is a far far better thing that I do than I have ever done; it is a far far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
23,feh... this IQ test said i'm only 138 i defend my low score with the fact that i was talking to complete idiots on the phone while taking it...
23,jeebus christ im at work at 8am on a monday...god this sucks
23,yeh i think i'm over it all now... back to just my computer and toys and comics...
23,did i mention it was raining
23,is it a sign of weakness to walk in the door and fall down in the middle of your bedroom floor and just start crying
23,let's be honest here... the whole thing would be like 'hey remember me i'm that little kid you wanted abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with'
23,i also looked up the last name in people.yahoo.com and had it draw a map...
23,hmm... you haven't locked me up yet... what if i tell you i honestly believe she liked me best but was just afraid of a relationship at the time is that enuff to sound crazy yet
23,okay maybe i'm very obsessed... to be spending all my free thoughts on someone i haven't seen in years... that's just plain committable... lock me up and throw away the key
23,i'm a bit obsessed...you know i still know her old license plate number =\
23,hmmm...maybe if i take my pill i won't be so pissed off at every little trivial thing
23,thoughts of her my hating myself all of these are just phases...and all of them pass...everything in my life is just a phase...and they all end
23,'...you are afraid of losing someone dear to you.'
23,messing around with the template...adding links added the counter from digits.com
23,also on the topic of dreams...had a bit of lucid earlier today right after work...i realized it was a dream when i started losing my teeth again...that happens so often in my dreams...not rotting or anything just like when a tooth comes loose when you're a child but i usually lose 2 or 3 or more in a dream...of which i've read in some meanings could be: '...you are afraid of losing someone dear to you.'
23,about the dream...while it had the usual 'this is a dream so everything is fucked up' aspects...it had me desperately vying for her attention...that part was pretty damn accurate
23,it is fitting that last nite i dreamt of her again...
23,Valentine's is a day only to piss off the single...
23,my updates as of late have been...lacking...to say the least
23,well not so much thinking more-so obsessing...
23,there was another dream... but i guess really it was just a cameo appearance
23,'It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something more It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone' -chorus Linkin Park - Easier to Run
23,'I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make sense I say what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do Face away and pretend that I'm not But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got' -verse 2 Linkin Park - Faint
23,how do i know that you're all not just figments of my imagination that i'm the only one that's real because i'm just not that damn creative...the comics i read the books the tv shows i watch the movies the games i play the people i know i could never come up with all of them just to create a world around me...
23,i like to escape reality... my imagination... and always the hero... tho sometimes a villian... but always the chivalrous one... protecting someone =\
23,i give myself one more month... then it'll be time to end this failed experiment called life...
23,i remember the dream... it was different because it was confrontational... and this page was involved too... but i actually stood up how unlike real life...
23,i can't decide... and what's worse even if i do decide to i constantly fail to act upon any decisions...
23,and what do i think of the whole Iraq thing well i've heard good points on both sides of the military action argument...
23,another dream... this one was a little different but i can't for the life of me remember it now...
23,it was a stupid idea anyway...
23,alright... getting off of work at 9:30... w00... maybe go out and get some dinner with my girl... catch a movie or something... oh... wait... =(
23,i don't even know how to approach or if i even should...
23,off and on for almost 10 years now...
23,why do i awaken early every day why am i not getting enough sleep
23,and if i had the chance what would i say haven't i said it all before to her even multiple times before over the course of several years...
23,it's not worth it... none of this is... the romantic in me wants to run away... the realist wants to die...
23,i know i know my poetry is contrived... trite... derivative...
23,'I didn't get to be with you Now you're stuck in my mind' Saliva - Bleed for Me off the Daredevil Soundtrack
23,i'm beginning to believe the dreams are someone up there having fun with me there's no point to me having such but someone up there knows it drives me insane...
23,i don't know which hurts more... the mistakes that i make... or the chances i don't take...
23,it has been awhile since the last... another dream
23,all i want is a chance with a love i've never known a love that's never left my heart no matter how far we are apart all i want is to know her for her to know i care to hold her in my arms to protect her from all harm but all that i am still just a little boy full of fear full of emotion afraid of what he'll be if just given a chance all i want is a cure to help clean up my life to cure the loneliness to clean up this mess all i want is an end a simple fucking end to this misery and strife to this simply fucked up life but all that i am still just a little boy full of fear full of emotion afraid of what he'll be if just given a chance - a chance
23,i guess when i'm not whining i don't have anything to say...
23,now there's an idea... probably a bad one at that though
23,the following was a look back at other times written now about times before as evidenced i've always been like this... the first part paints a picture for you the latter explains what the picture does to me and how in the end its all i can do to hope to forever battle against myself for this...
23,golden locks exquisite eyes a smile that makes men kill shapely form mentally keen and an elating intonation euphoria takes control and forever i am lost like so many others who came before victim to mine own lust a turbulent battle ensues hormones emotion and wit and all three lose and even yet all three seemingly win what power latches onto me what evil do i grapple a prisoner to my own accords i cannot even fight time and time again the cycle forever endures and to have it any other way i wouldn't even dare - '03 untitled 1
23,what is this all about an empty bed in an empty house and i don't mean sex... i mean falling asleep in another's arms... another falling asleep in mine own...
23,this whole page this is what i do to the people i love...i go on and on with this...how can i put another through this am i that selfish
23,weeeee... i take daily vitamin now... it chewable
23,maybe i am just a hopeless romantic... or maybe just hopeless
23,pathetically obsessed over a girl who probably wouldn't even give me the time of day... hating my job more and more... IRC has become contrived channel politics are enough to make anyone want to die or atleast leave...
23,my friends have real problems and here i am nagging about juvenile fantasies...
23,the funny part is i haven't taken my anti-depressants in a couple of weeks... and i feel fine... then again it could be because i'm so distracted... but if i can be distracted is it really a chemical imbalance induced depression or is just me being a wretched soul crying for attention hmm...
23,and you ask me what irony 'Hope all your dreams come true Love (name withheld)' that irony...
23,i found myself driving by that old house... empty now...
23,even my job is telling me to just fucking die already...
23,and the one person who could actually help me get in touch with her or at the very least let me know how she's been i don't even broach the subject with...
23,i haven't even spoken to her in a year and yet she's all i can think of now...god what's wrong with me...
23,i was pretty sure from the picture that i had found it but when i zoomed in on the map on expedia and saw the name of the road in front of it i knew that was it...sigh
23,Daredevil was suprisingly damn good... the soundtrack fowns too...
23,god i feel sick... i let the bad man of #a-g win... i quit the channel... and something this stupid is tearing me apart...
23,i want to see her... but i know how it will go i know these dreams just torture me i know they will shatter i know i will fall... and right now in my life i have no one to run to when they break... perhaps i should go back on my medication... perhaps i should let the dreams go...
23,another dream... my god it felt so perfect
23,god the cruelty of this torture...it's been far too long...
23,apparently one of my ISP's nameservers takes forever to update because if i nslookup through it it still points to namezero while the other is up to date... also it seems the dreams have returned...
23,i could solve most of my problems if i just put a box up and hosted on that...but argh...
23,yey looks the blog will have to forward unmasked/uncloaked because i don't get a title and meta tags for each forward just one damn title for all subdomains... sigh also all the whois and everything show the new location but my ISP's DNS is still pointing to the old... =\
23,today will be fun comics tho...lots of money...Transformers: Generation 1 Volume 2: War & Peace...there's like 8 covers
23,dealing with registrars...fun and the dreams returned last nite...
23,it's about time i get up off my lazy ass and do something...
23,i just read 3 Daredevil TPB's written by Brian Michael Bendis; Wake Up (DD Vol.
23,oops it was my understanding that i get a $30 credit towards an amazon purchase but it turns out instead they're gonna give me a $30 gift certificate code on my first monthly statement...whoops...oh well...ill just find something else to buy then...the oops is i just bought this other stuff and am forever putting myself into debt... i'll prolly just use this card like John plans to use it to pay online purchases (for the Amazon points) then just pay it immediately thus getting the points and keeping the balance at $0 then again i just xfred $200 from my other VISA to it so that's a cpl months just to get that back to $0... oops...
23,yeh i said that last night to try and trigger one... and it worked too...
23,it's been awhile since the last dream perhaps they've stopped...
23,You are Morpheus from 'The Matrix.'
23,i can't go on like this...
23,even now i can feel the tears starting...
23,i don't know if it's sweet or just plain creepy... i drive around town and can remember things from 5 years ago from 9 years ago...
23,and then there's the realist in me... i know it would never work i haven't even seen her in years... or spoken in over a year... if she's changed i don't even know her anymore... if she hasn't changed well did i ever really know her then there's the question that really irks me why why would i choose to fixate myself on her... is she the proverbial 'one that got away' is that why i'm doing this or is it something more like a chemical inbalance that i'm choosing not to treat...
23,what i felt was true before has been ripped from me... time and time again i have something good and it never lasts... and yet i choose to live in the past... remembering the people i loved and remembering the pain they caused me... hoping that i can perhaps change things that what i felt was still true despite their denials...
23,i believe there are two sides to me... the hopeless romantic and the cynical bastard... i believe there are more things in this earth than we can understand and i believe in destiny... but i also believe in choice... how can there be destiny and choice wouldn't who we are control our choices and yet each choice would redefine who we are... i want to believe dreams have meaning our actions are with reason... i dunno anymore...
23,that and because of my stupid insurance i still owe my doctor's office $55
23,well all i need to be elligible to receive financial aid again is a note from my doctor that verifies that i'm being treated and that he 'thinks i'm ready to return to school'... that might be a problem though with my inability to ever make my doctor's appointments...
23,turns out my package wasn't stolen but it wasn't delivered either...Amazon and UPS is having problems in this area as i've been told by my coworker that he recently had an item returned to Amazon for having the wrong address even though a second box that was the same order came through just fine... supposedly my book should be delivered monday =\
23,i need to see her... despite the pain it will cause... perhaps the hurting will end this whole dream thing...
23,well it seems i had a package stolen from my front porch today within 10 minutes of it being delivered...
23,but don't you feel betrayed no... not really...
23,i should give up... just give it all up
23,what the hell am i thinking...
23,each night i die from dreams of blue and gold
23,I'm addicted to stress that's the way that I get things done If I'm not under pressure then I sleep too long And I hang around like a bum And I think I'm going nowhere and that makes me nervous Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright Everybody's thinking about me.
23,or it doesnt... it does make it hard to get up the next day tho...but that could be because im trying to get away with only a few hours of sleep...
23,my Wolverine broke a claw so he's being sent back for a replacement
23,okay... 100mg of 5-HTP a night does weird shit to j3
23,alright 1-10 let's run down the summer movies so far as rated by me... X2: 9 or 10 Matrix Reloaded 7 or 8 (will go up prolly when i can watch Revlotions right after it) Hulk: 6 or 7 T3: 8 LXG: 5 Pirates: 6 or 7 Tomb Raider: 5 or 6
23,is anyone else sick of the redundance of these
23,hand holding - you like to be in constant physical contact with your special someone but you don't want to take things too quickly.
23,noone ever says they miss me noone ever says let's get together noone ever says they think of me noone ever says ANYTHING to me... and you people wonder why i feel so f-ing alone...
23,hmph i had some clearly non-Vash answers i guess the Vash still won out tho... LAABBU ANDO PIIIIIIIIIIIISU LAABBU ANDO PIIIIIIIIIIIISU (love and peace)
23,I am Vash the Stampede the Humanoid Typhoon I am a hunter of peace chasing the mayfly known as love.
23,saw T3 a few nights ago... it's sometimes failed attempts at humor not withstanding it was a great movie that still manages to capture the Terminator feel... and despite the lack of one James Cameron it's still a great follow-up that manages to revitalize the franchise... and oh yeh EVERYONE DIES
23,another dream where i'm being ignored... maybe i should take the hint...
23,this city is run by idiots... fireworks at 5:45am so the dogs next door start barking too... i had just lied down for bed... so that made it a little hard to fall asleep but i finally did... then comes 11:00am the fucking parade and all the fucking sirens and dogs barking because of the sirens...so i get back to bed at noon...
23,what's my 2 cents well life sucks... sometimes it sucks more for other people sometimes more for yourself... our 'God' likes to play sick jokes on us... makes me feel guilty for not being able to help and for even thinking my life sucks when it pales in comparison... and it makes me feel bad that i don't even know what to say about it... that's what i think =\
23,I just don't know what to do with myself I don't know what to do with myself planning everything for two doing everything with you and now that we're through I just don't know what to do I just don't know what to do with myself I don't know what to do with myself movies only make me sad parties make me feel as bad 'cause I'm not with you I just don't know what to do like a summer rose needs the sun and rain I need your sweet love to beat love away well I don't know what to do with myself just don't know what to do with myself planning everything for two doing everything with you and now that we're through I just don't know what to do like a summer rose needs the sun and rain I need your sweet love to beat love away I just don't know what to do with myself just don't know what to do with myself just don't know what to do with myself I don't know what to do with myself The White Stripes - I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself
23,i wonder what brought on the dream this time... the migraine last night the repeated listening to Dennis Leary - Asshole or the on-again/off-again thunderstorms we've been having or maybe a little bit of all or none cus it's just a dream get over it... asshole...
23,there's really no excuse you all should be ashamed
23,i just don't know what to do... i'm trying to find a part-time job (in place of my abscence of school) something like opening retail or something... but i realized i really have no 'references' anymore... also trying to fill out an application for a different job (would involve me quitting XTN) but i have no idea what i'm even supposed to put for the desired position on it...
23,it's times like this i wish i really had the strength to take my own life... i mean it's not just the money... if not for jenn in the first place i'd prolly still be living next door in the back of the house... i can almost guarantee that in 20 years i'll still be right here in this house all alone in some dead-end job (possibly even the same dead-end job)... i tried school even tried socializing there neither went all that great... now all i do is work and come home and work and home work home work home... i've complained about it for some time now over and over again i guess i should've added that to the repetition (work home bitch work home whine work home moan work home complain etc)
23,the bank just tried to cash a check for 2.99 and it went negative then another...so im also currently $47 in the hole just because i ordered 2 'free' G.I.Joe action figures
23,there's nothing wrong with pacing around the house worried about nothing in particular but feeling very worried nevertheless... right
23,let's seeeeeee.... Star Trek: Enterprise 's 'new direction' is kinda eh... i like the idea of Archer roughing people up cus they whole crew is pissed off but the blatant and unbelievable sexing up is meh... atleast give reason to it... Once Upon a Time in Mexico was pretty good... BANG BANG the Conan O'Brien 10th anniversary special was great... haha o.O O.o what nothing else... go away...
23,i realized the other day i quit thinking about her everyday... of course that means i now do again... way to go idiot...

23,Like all bad things in my life it started with the death of a woman...
23,just finished my first time through Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne if you played the original you HAVE to play this... if you didn't play the original you HAVE to play this... and the original... but seriously this has everything that made the first such a masterpiece but better graphics and a physics (rag-doll) engine... another top-notch noir story... gripping to the end... i've been waiting for this game for some time now and i finally got it the day before i'm leaving town...so yes i stayed up all night playing it =D
23,discussing about why The Bride 's name was beeped someone mentioned maybe it was a cuss word to which i replied that couldn't be it because the name of the movie could've easily been: Blood Fuck Blood spray Fucking Fuck Kill Fucking Blood Blood Bill Fuck so yeh cussing was okay...
23,now we will discuss a small film from some no-name director Quentin Tarantino called Kill Bill Vol.
23,i had the most wonderful dream last night... it was one of my 'normal' dreams the type where nothing is dream-like everything is just like a normal day... but it was a very good with happy thoughts i have decided not to share... and i'm proud to say it was followed by what most people would call a normal dream where everything is all crazy and we're trying to wake up someone who has trouble waking up but when they wake up can read people's minds and that's how we get the news... a normal dream...
23,so i've been playing Knights of the Old Republic getting to choose dark things is fun 'YOU KNOW TOO MUCH YOU MUST DIE' seriously tho why Lucasarts keeps shoving the trilogy based game shit down our throats is ridiculous the Expanded Universe has so much more and this game has sold so well maybe they'll notice and make more... i mean they can't say EU games will fail anymore after seeing the numbers on a game set 4000 years before the fall of the Republic.
23,last night's dreams were much better a little on the strange side but good enough that i considered calling in sick just so that i may fall asleep and dream some more...
23,so i had the strangest dream last night...
23,My life is rated R. What is your life rated

23,so i'm taking next friday off giving myself a 3 day weekend since i'll be working through the holiday and i want to get out of town... this would normally be where someone tells me to go to Knoxville call up Kristal... all those times i never did that dammit
23,i have so many regrets but the largest is that i let us grow so far estranged...
23,i cannot sleep... i sit here helpless hating myself for not being there still afraid to go though as a friend i loved so much continues to whither away.
23,so i started third shift today... M-F mornings 00:00-08:00
23,My life has been rated: Suitable for 15 years or older.
23,remember when i used to actually talk about things on here yeh i can't really either but if you check the archives apparently i used to...

23,i know i'm not that good with money but can someone tell me how it is i am supposed to pay $300 to my loans $300 to the gas company any other utilities' bills that come in the next 2 weeks and not to mention groceries and gas for my car all out of a $550 paycheck
23,and tonight is a perfect end for a crappy week starting Sunday night my DSL kept dropping connection and there was a lot of static on my phone... Thursday Sprint ran a new line and everything is now fine that day I had to stand outside with the Sprint guy and ended up breaking out from Posion Ivy and such... today i went and bought some Benadryl and am using something called 'Ivy Dry' so now my 120GB harddrive has went and died on me... i took my Benadryl went to bed and when i returned Windows was reporting that E: is not formatted would you like to format it now chkdsk is unable to repair it but apparently the data is still there will try to boot into Knoppix to see if i can copy some files over before having to re-format the drive i also am dogsitting a dog that despite being taken out will come back in and avoid the 'pee-pad' i've laid down altogether and go piss on my bedroom carpet (3 fucking times now)
23,and with the latest version of the browser formerly known as Phoenix then known as Firebird now known as Firefox; the blogger posting window is working correctly again (of course i could post before im just saying it looks correct now) don't worry i will still continue seldomly posting though
23,Which 1990's Subculture Do You Belong To [Another Quiz by Kris @ couplandesque.net ]
23,The Shield was great tonight though the preview for next week's episode completely blew it away... anyway Julien's problems at home Julien and Danny back together the Strike Team wins one over the Decoy Squad Shane and Tavon have at it and Tavon's apparent death... next week not only will they have to deal with tonight's events but the events of last season's finale and the season 3 opener... the money given to Diego a few episodes ago include marked bills (something i was thinking about after that ep myself) Vic finds out there are marked bills in their stash from the Money Train heist a decision must be made about the money Aceveda held at gunpoint by Diego it's all hitting the fan in what should be one hell of a culmination... weeeeeeeee
23,Super Link updates: 07-09 waiting on typeset 10-11 waiting on translation 12 raw is out to staff for timing/translation 13 airs Friday new The Shield tonight went to doctor put me on a 2 week antibiotic treatment for an enlarged prostate
23,trying to keep my mind busy with 'work' (fansub project work not my job that requies no brain) still haven't received a 'final' (i quote that because i always have to make corrections after receiving it) script for 05... oh i got the 07 script from the translator but am waiting to pass to the typesetter to see if i can get a better raw for this episode while i'm downloading today's 11 the initial 07 and 08 i had the audio is out of sync to the video at times... i got a replacement 08 last week now just need to try to get that 07... and if i do adjust the times on the script to match the new...
23,and tonight is a new episode of the coveted j3's choice for Best Television Drama award The Shield
23,SUUPAARRRRRRRRRRINKU UPDATE 03 is encoded and out to distro 04 will be encoded today 05 script should be sent back to me today encode tommorow 06 was sent to the typesetter earlier 07-09 waiting on translator 10 either on timer or translator 11 airs in Japan on Friday and domestically the show went into re-runs for atleast the next couple weeks after airing 07 last Saturday... so one more episode translated and we'll be caught up to the dub... \o/
23,05 is edited and off to the typesetter i'll prolly work on 06 tonight since I'll need to sleep sometime today...
23,w00t got the scripts for 05 and 06 and once i get home i'll be downloading this weeks episode 10.
23,i've taken over editing for Transformers Super Link and since then 03 and 04 have passed through my hands and off for typesetting and translation check and such... after that back to me for encoding... now i need to bug the translator for 5-9 =D
23,last night was the season premiere for one of my personal favorite shows on television The Shield and from all looks of it season 3 is gonna have even more uNF than the last 2 seasons =P
23,#AiA is re-awakening from the horror that was FFXI (half the staff were suckered into that vile realm)... and i'm supposed to be getting a new GGG ep to QC soon... yey
23,my first encode for #TV-N should be released later today Transformers Super Link - 02 and we've had the translated script for 03 since monday... but not edited/typeset/and such... with the translator hard at work on catching up... (if only i could say the same for the editor a job i could easily do and quicker)... today in Japan Super Link 09 aired (meaning we're 7 eps behind now) and tomorrow Energon (the domestic/dubbed Super Link) 06 airs... if they could just finish the scripts i'd have us caught up to the domestic atleast before next week airs 07... sigh #AiA has been pretty dead for some time i think the next GaoGaiGar is nearing completion soon though...
23,i've been having those dreams again...
23,Super Link 12 should be released tonight or tommorow... still no sign of a script for 13 from Mr. BigJ'contstantly AWOL'Studd...
23,some people would say my self-doubt is one of my major weaknesses... but from another point-of-view it's the only sign that i'm still sane... the insane man would believe every crazy thought he has where i doubt every single thing i do and say...
23,where's the border between sweet and creepy
23,Abortion: it's not my body to choose... Death Penalty: if you're damned sure he did it...
23,also Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair will reportedly be shown at Cannes this year that's right Tarantino is showing a cut of Vol.1 and Vol.
23,so i was flipping through Previews (it's a monthly catalog for upcoming comics and other comic store merchandise) and see a solicit for Kill Bill the Novel written by Quentin Tarantino which leaves me to wonder.. 'does he write like he speaks' if so i believe it'd be something like this Okay see The Bride drops her pregnancy test alright and like she bends over okay so like then a big hole is shot through the door okaaayy And it's like 2 fucking inches above her okay Like she's only 2 inches below the shotgun blast okaaay And see like The Bride ducks for cover alright cus she's like THE BRIDE okay like she's THE mother fucking BRIDE Like SHE's the bitch you go to to get people killed alright So she's like behind the bed aiming her gun at the assassin okay So like the assassin is there holding a shotgun at the Bridge alright So like The Bride says 'You any good with that thing' okaay.
23,The Shield was good last night... Super Link 12 script was sent off to typeset and some t/l checking... i'm being an idiot... nothing really new there though...
23,Super Link 10 and 11 should be released later tonight... working on the script for 12 right now...
23,almost off... one more frickin' hour... currently listening to Hoobastank - The Reason
23,oh yeh stupid SpikeTV started over at Season 1 last week even after marathoning all the way up to Season 3... so it'll be June before the real shite starts airing
23,i had the greastest dream last night... though for the life of me i can't even remember it now... i just remember waking up feeling it was such a great dream... i also had a couple of other weird ones =P
23,if it's not one thing it's something else... today i can't get back to sleep because it feels like someone is taking a hammer and just repeatedly hitting my left temple with it...
23,when does it become an obsession
23,damn hype machine... don't get me wrong tonight's The Shield was great with what's sure to be some lasting repricussions but we won't really see any of this for some time... next week is another filler looks to be a damn good filler ep but still a filler... currently listening to: Jeff Buckley - Hallelujah
23,OMG OMG OMG OMG SpikeTV is marathoning Star Trek - Deep Space Nine this week... noon-9pm... which should finish seasons 1 and 2 by Friday at 9pm then kicking off the 'Trek Uncut' DS9 Friday night with the Season 3 premiere 2 parter... next week DS9 goes to nightly M-F at 7pm i assume continuing with Season 3 (they probably wanted to rush through the first 2 seasons to get to the Jem'Hadar and the Dominion) i havent gotten to see any DS9 since like 2000 or 2001 when my local affiliate's syndication ran out... i used to stay up to 3am each night just to watch the episodes... now i'll be able to wake up early each night to watch DS9 before work... yesssss i should just buy the DVDs but Paramount wants $100+ per box... and it's 7 seasons =(
23,anyway on tommorow night's The Shield : THE CRIME... they can no longer hide...
23,i wanna get hit over the head
23,well SpikeTV seems to be skipping over any finales and 2 parters feh.
23,so i went to the comic store yesterday and got Astonishing X-Men #1 by Joss Whedon and John Cassady and... OMG this is the X-Men book I've been wanting.
23,If there is one person you can't stop thinking about post this same exact sentence in your journal.
23,well after the recent disappointment with Masterforce 's imminent delay i received a private message on The Allspark from a mr. Buster Darkwings.
23,so looks like SpikeTV decided to double-up on DS9 episodes a night (replacing TNG with a second DS9 ep) and finally they'll be catching up this week to what they had aired during the marathon... so season 3 here we come
23,so i'm looking at Virgin Mobile for a pre-paid they only require a $20 top-off every 90 days...
23,i made promises to myself and to departed friends that i would make an effort to better myself... i'm still just sitting back and complaining as i watch life pass me by.
23,weee... guy i got the Victory copies from just had his order of Transformers Masterforce boxsets 1 and 2 shipped to him from Japan today so i should have copies of those in a couple weeks =P
23,so on tonight's The Shield Aceveda exacts his revenge on his rapists and the Strike Team is on the trail after last week's 'WE'RE BACK' ending... and what about Mara sending that 7 grand to her mother that included marked bills
23,preccciousssss... DVD-R copies for Transformers Victory box set 1 came in the mail today and best of all using the file browser on my set-top DVD player i can watch them on my TV =D ahhh the air just tastes better today
23,well i'm back on irc now in #tv-nihon atleast... mainly to quell the imaginations of those who believed i left because of them...
23,well trying to get Blogger's new features to work i've changed Templates (which is good anyway as i was sick of sharing one with WPP Fansubs (j/k guys))... and am having to republish the entire thing... let's hope this works... i'll get to customizing the thing later...
23,jeebus gas prices jumped a dime in the last week or so... plain ole vanilla unleaded is from 1.779 to 1.799 'round here... with Super Mega GOD LIKE unleaded just under the $2 barrier at 1.999... i can't even remember a time when this area was above $2/gallon
23,yawn it's been more than 48 hours since i've even been on IRC...
23,talked to mr. translator the other day he is interested in doing Masterforce but not until after Super Link is finished he's having a hard enough time keeping up there (duh we're further behind than ever)... bottom line: Masterforce won't be around for atleast another 9 months (34 weeks of SL episodes remain) plus the time it takes to catch up... why they felt they had to address me about my other post is beyond me its the same things i've been bitching about to them for weeks... hence my 'that was kind of stupid...'
23,so it scored a wound or two... it lost the battle... the lawn has been conquered... for now...
23,update ran out of gas so while its cooling down for refuel i come in to get a glass of tea and take some Benadryl (the allergenic horrors out there) and while sitting at my pc i see blood drops on my shirt look at my wrist rest and find a blood stain pooling... somehow i cut my wrist open sooo the count so far is 4 band-aids (3 to cover the length of the burn 1 on the wrist) before the day is through i will have used my entire Neosporin tube and an entire box of band-aids THIS I SWEAR
23,damn your outside world damn your lawnwork i'm not out there more than 5 minutes and i've give myself a 2nd degree burn i'm just that talented
23,well that was kind of stupid... and hello all you other people out there...
23,i was told to expect a script for 13 and 14 this weekend... well the weekend is over... =/ i hate my project staff... if the translator really wants to do Masterforce also he better get his ass in gear... when he 'tried out' it only took him 2 days to give us a script now its up to 2 weeks... if it was gonna be this long id've said 'NO YOU GO TO HELL' alas... it's not fair... then there's the typesetter that takes another week after i'm done editing and she edits more and screws up stupid little things i then have to fix before encoding... not gonna be that way on Masterforce or Victory though i'll be handling everything excepting timing and tranlsation on those... but i still need a punctual translator...
23,You are most like Robin A leader and fearless by nature you tend to dive straight into something without thinking.
23,Spider-Man 2 ... no words to describe it... go see it.
23,damn dreams... sometimes they make me think of the possible good... sometimes they show me the possible bad... it was a conversation the night before though that made that dream what it was... it won't influence me anyway i gave up long ago...
23,weeee... i got Masterforce 03 back and re-timed fast... still waiting on the guy who's doing 02... still no Super Link ... he's supposed to be given an ultimatum failing that we may be going back to the original translator... he's timely and i found his scripts much easier to work with too so if i must go back to him no complaints from me =P
23,so The Shield season is over and that means atleast 8 months till anything new (DVDs probably in January hopefully Season 4 will start then too) I wouldn't mind a new comic if they get someone who might have actually seen an episode or two (the one that just finished was freaking horrible)... so anyway i hope to see some new licensing stuff (i'd love some action figures) otherwise it's going to be a long wait... currently listening to Daft Punk - Digital Love
23,(semi)weekly Transformers subbing bitching: still no scripts for Super Link still no The Headmasters release (meaning still no Masterforce release) waiting on a timer to retime Masterforce 02 right now...
23,They've seen every threat a cop can face but nothing could brace them for this...
23,Super Link 13 and 14 are released in TV-Nihon... Masterforce 01 is waiting for The Headmasters 01 (not my project) to be ready for some dual classic TF release thingy...
23,With only two episodes left you can't afford to miss a single moment... A ruthless crime-lord is out for revenge... And the pressure's on to catch him first... Who will keep their cool... And who will self destruct This is the episode... That sets up The Shield season finale...
23,i may get in trouble for this post oh well... so here's the dilly i finally got Super Link 13 (after 2 weeks) back from the typesetter to find she had gone through and changed several puncuation and capitalization and various other things despite my explicitly telling her not to worry about editing anyway (she's supposed to check the typeset (since i apply most of the styles now before it even gets to her) and check translation on a few lines for me) what's worse is after all her editing she still missed several bad spellings and such (one that I even missed until after my first encode)... and i still haven't recieved 14 from her... as for 15+ from the Translator well... i get to blame the typesetter again He apparently had thought since 13 and 14 still weren't out yet after 2 weeks then we must've taken a small summer break and i guess he didn't want to create a backlog of scripts for me... on to Masterforce the aforemetioned typesetter threw a fit because I didn't use her on the project (this while i was still waiting on 13 and 14 from her) also all of WPP were upset that i wasn't trying to release a 175MB version.
23,the first episode of Transformers Super-God Masterforce should be released in a day or two or so... time to get cracking on 02... Super Link 13 and 14 are still waiting on typeset and 15+ from the seemingly once again AWOL translator =also encoding New Getter Robo (the 2004 New Getter Robo as opposed to the old New Getter Robo) for TV-N 02 is on the slab for encode today so expect that to be released in a couple of days too...
23,They've turned the law upside down...
23,and still i dream of her... how long must this go on
23,that was mean... the dream didn't start until the last time i fell asleep right before the alarm went off =\
23,Masterforce updates: 04 and 05 are in distro 06 and 07 are being edited/typeset Super Link : 16 is in QC/pre-distro 17 is in final edits before encode 18 is being translated 19+ timing...
23,so i still have trouble getting to sleep... usually my head just won't shut up... lately i've been writing letters in my head... to old loves old friends friends lost...
23,RARGH so i'm afraid to change anything in this script because this guy seems to get very upset when things aren't exactly like he did it... now he puts in an abbreviation ('Jr' instead of 'Junior') anyway I left it as 'Jr' because that's what he had in the script and that's what was on the title card anyway... so this is what i get: Hrm there were a couple of changes made to my script...
23,since i've been withdrawn lately here's more TF updates instead... Super Link ... still no 18 timed (over a week) still no 17 translated (almost a week) still no 16 typeset (5 days)... kind of hard to catch up when we're taking longer than a week per episode... Masterforce ... 03 has been released and 04 is being encoded today...
23,Super Link is chugging along now... 15 should be released today 16 is at the typesetters 17 is in translation and the timer is burning through the rest... Masterforce 01 and 02 have been released 03 is being encoded as i type...
23,Super Link has been in secret works for a flood of 15-25 meanwhile we still haven't heard back from the 'current' translator... so buh-bye to him... Masterforce 02-03 are getting finishing touches done to the script... hopefully to be encoded sometime this weekend or so (yes 01 still hasn't been released it's been sitting at the distro peeps for almost a month now sigh)
23,either my killing the power system at work (funny story) or Ted's wanting to put Doom3 on his FTP at work (because he wouldn't stop till the damned connection worked)... one of these i have to thank for my work connection back to its full glory... weeee... i didn't find out till early Friday morning right before leaving so i can't wait to get to work tonight and send out mass amounts of files just to be doing so =P Transformers Super Link 18 is in distro release any day... 19 is waiting on typeset 20+ on timing still... Masterforce 07 in distro release any day... 08 was encoded today for QC and distro 09-10 i have scripts and need to finish them... had another dream earlier today it was a very good one... going to take some time off of work in a couple weeks... i COULD do something but will probably lounge around the house maybe get some cleaning done or something...
23,well i found out why the last couple days my connection has seemed slower and i could only send files at 15K/s tops... apparently someone at Sprint noticed that they had uncapped by line speed and have since fixed it back to 576/160 kbps now add to the fact i can no longer plug in outside the firewall at work without the connection dropping every minute or so (you'd think they would've fixed that by now but nooooooooo) means i can't send files to people at all (or atleast at a decent speed from here)... makes fansubbing work a little harder... will have to rely on BT from behind the firewall and such... maybe if i switch to an actual XTN provided circuit i can get uncapped speed at home (i've heard it mentioned) at the lowest rate's price... but still this shit with my work connection should've been fixed months ago...
24,I am sleepy and tired and just wanted to post what I am thinking about.
24,I just wanted to play around with posting more pics to see how well I understand this process.

27,Maybe I should just change my name to Nick.
27,So Gore just conceded and it looks like the dubya will be the next president of the United States of America.

27,Everything I know I learned by killing smart people and eating their brains hey go listen to 'mope' by the bloodhound gang.
27,Quick question: would you rather be addicted to heroin or crack I mean if you aren't already addicted to one of them (since that would bias you) and if you for some reason absolutely had to be addicted to one of them which one would it be I think I'd go for crack.

27,I wake up screaming in the middle of the night.
27,Man I have got to do something about all these people driving thru my yard.
27,Lately two questions have been racing thru my head: 'Why do I feel the need to set my head on fire at family reunions' and 'Did I build that hedge maze out front just to piss off the mailman' No answers seem to be in sight.
27,I was thinking of naming my blog Gordon or something.
27,Is it ever really Tuesday Is Tuesday just a relative term what if some aliens came to earth and thought us to be savages because we use this wildly inaccurate and archaic system for measuring time I just noticed that my last two posts invloved getting pants damp so I'll just go ahead and make it a hat trick: Damn I should have rolled up my cuffs before we walked across that gigantic sponge.

33,what an end to my week.
33,for some reason today was my angry day.
33,Today was the first time I experienced a hot day in San Francisco.
33,and thus begins my attempt to journal all that is not exciting.
33,i think i ate too much.
33,and so another week goes by and I realize that I still don't have a routine down.
33,Apparently my new hobby is completely over scheduling myself in my free time.
33,My last official day of unemployment wasn't a complete bust with thanks to some of my friends.
33,what a week... once again overbooked and crazy but that's better than over worked and crazy so sign me up for another week.
33,The thieves knew what they wanted I like to picture them with a list in hand something written neatly in cursive on a 'from the desk of...' notepad: Things to get from old Saturn today ~ catalytic converter pipe muffler rear bumper interior center panel various and random parts of air filter battery cover air filter cover manual pennies covered in spilled soda map of San Francisco and an anti theft club.
33,Last night Alex and I had a blast First we had a little visit to the Emeryville police station and then took an exciting trip down memory lane by stopping off at the Richmond police station.
33,Last night I got home (after a smooth ride in the Grand Prix) to find that I had no cable.
33,it's been awhile and although I could write about a lot of things that have happened in the past 2 weeks I would much rather whine about my car being stolen.
33,In my ambition to be more domestically creative I attempted to make a peanut butter chocolate pie Sunday night.
33,I've been struggling with insomnia lately and sadly I turn to my fine friend - TV (accompanied by cheap cable) for comfort.
33,Things finally feel like they are starting to turn around for me.
33,Is it wrong to like being behind the wheel of an SUV Is it bad to feel empowered for having a height advantage I'm feeling guilty for my new found love of bigger cars.
33,Because I thought that yesterday was going to be the last day with the Grand Prix (which I think I may have grown to like) I figured I should end it on an ironic note and decided to listen to the Smiths on the way into work.
33,and as it turns out our haunted house kicked some serious ass.
33,In the grand scale of the cosmos I'm not really sure what this means... but I feel that it's worth mentioning.
33,Christmas time is always a little hectic when I try to finish up those final details at the last minute everything else in my life seems to fall to pieces.
33,I can't remember when I last went to a Toys R Us (I just hate giving my money to a big crappy toy store like that...) and if I had remembered how visually assaulting it was I probably would have not set foot in one again.
33,I ended up making three of those chocolate peanut butter pies... they were a hit and somehow they got renamed 'crack pie'.
33,Last night I spent some quality time on the couch watching some seriously crappy TV.
33,I just went into the lunch room here at work to get some gum and the television was on.

16,Dont ever try to please someone if its gonna change who you are...its not worth it...you'll end up questioning yourself and most of the time the person won't even like you because they didnt like you for who you really were... so ya thats it(i bet everyone has said that once in their life...o well) BE WHO YOU ARE MAN im crying rite now...no not really but i would if i could..or if i wanted to i dont know it just seems to me that a lotta people rite now are doing that sort of thing...but o well... its high school...so i guess all that this blog really means is is that im single and im lovin' it.........well not really lovin it but not hatin ya know...cuz there are definitely too many hatas' in this world...i think every one will agree with me on that one...but ya i just need someone to TURN UP THE HEAT...or something...OR FREEZE ME...nothing in between...dont want that lukewarm stuff...ya...but i guess thats upo to GOD...and well....thats fine...

16,ya dude its sunday and its hot outside and its a great day to be alive...ya it is...i dont know why but im just glad that im not out doing something i dont want to be doing because then i just wouldnt want to be there and thats not what anybody wants...so ya its all good...but no basically i'm pretty much recovered fully from Boston...it was amazing...no words can describe what happened on that trip but ya it was just sweet seeing everyone on that trip just letting God take them wherever HE wanted them to go...nothing like it...another cool thing was to see how many lives were changed in just a short amount of time...i mean in a week 95 people got saved...that just amazes me...but im not the one to underestimate God...yet i Do sooo many times and i think thats what this trip was mainly about for me...just giving everything up to God and knowing that God will do what he wants and itll all work for the GOOD...I doubt God sometimes and i just gotta realize...HE CREATeD the UNIVERSE...i think he can handle a little thing like getting my Backpack back to me in a small city called BOSTON(which i lost but was brought back to me somehow...) and ya it just amazes me that when you give it to God he doesnt leave ya HANgin'...and well...i think thats pretty cool...

Hey i just thought this would be a good thing to share w/ yall.

16,Hey I've decided to make a change of venue and try something a litte bit more different than LJ.
34,I've had a couple of these dreams in the last few years I'm not sure what they mean yet.
34,I'm in a junkyard a really big one.
34,So I got a better night's sleep last night.
34,He died last year at the age of twenty.
34,...and yet I got 7 hours of sleep last night.
34,Okay so the insomnia is getting to me.
34,I got about 3.5 hours sleep last night altogether; waking up and taking a while to get back to sleep.
34,I was parousing the other Blog profiles just now and saw that someone put dogfighting in their interests.
34,I just saw a post on Craig's List entitled 'Sleep is for the Damned' .....hmm.
34,I didn't get to sleep until about 4AM.
34,[This is more an explanation than a dream but for future information] I have had a few common recurring metaphors in my dreams; one of them being spiders.
34,We were all getting ready for a big event.
34,So Dan and I were out driving at night I can't remember why.
34,So Wednesday morning my mother called me and told me that it was time to put my dog down.

15,I just got Homeworld today; yes I know it's three-something years old; yes I know there's two more game that are out supposedly even better; however I felt the need to start from the beginning and more importantly the original was 9.99 whereas Cataclysm and Homeworld 2 were 19.99 and up.
15,And one I made myself...: Probably the best people/things in the world (aside of course from ninjas and pirates) are orangutans.
15,Basically if you can calculate some random ratios write up some impossibly complex equations and add some nonsense about 'space-time continuum' all the while writing with a condescending and omniscient tone you may have the ability to write a book on science which up to this point was reserved for people with the aforesaid skills and who also possessed some sort of 'degree' (which really only means they get some letters after their name; I can therefore conclude from this that all scientists are morons and I know more than any of them) which gave them some inane thing like 'credibility' 'experience' 'relevance' or even the absolutely useless 'knowledge'.
15,I go to the Andover Summer Program in Massachusetts where I'm taking a filmmaking class on the 29th.

15,Okay well who ever this is reading this hello.
15,Hello world.. well i have to say things are finally looking brighter these days.. For starters i had the most awesome week at the fair (even though it's hicksville USA).
15,i was happy once..when i sit and look out the window i remember all of the times when i smiled without a care in the world..before the dramas of being a teenager..all of the memories of the days when i was happy bring me to tears because i know that i am not that little girl anymore.. the little girl who loved her daddy and would play baseball football and soccer with him in the backyard all the time and a game of cards when it was too gloomy to go outside or the girl who always wanted a little brother or sister who sat in the large patch of four-leaf clovers and talked to God about her problems or would lay in the snow and feel the world turning while watching the clouds fly by or always looked at the sunny days and thought they were beautiful and never really liked a cloudy day or enjoyed school and didn't really mind the other kids there who never knew how parents really acted like when they were in another room and who looked in the mirror and smiled because she liked being the person she was.. thats not me anymore..she's been gone for a long time now..that little girl grew up and saw what the world was really like..that her daddy was an asshole and can never find a nice thing to say about her and that siblings can be quite anoiying who came to the conclusion that God was never really listening to the girl by the four-leaf clovers and she lost touch with the world to the point that she didnt feel the earth moving while laying in the snow and now those sunny days are the worst and the gloomy days are what she can relate to best she came to hate people and school because she lived in an atmosphere with so many fights that it was all she came to know and expect from people..and now she has the mirror covered so she wouldnt have to see the person looking back at her and remember who she really is and what she really looks like.. its hard to stay possitive and move on with your life when you still cant get ovet the fact that you were that little girl and your not anymore and you cant ever get her back..although i'm trying to change some of the things that tear me down in life i'm broken and i can never be fully repaired..because i was happy once.. i was happy once..
15,for a while i've always stayed pulled over on the side of the road because i had no idea which dirrection i was suppose to in.

24,So we're all happy IBM is defending our turf.
24,Continuing from the brief bit about the iPod I've been looking into getting a new cell phone lately and I can't help but he struck by all the ridiculous proprietary formats and interfaces that plague these devices.
24,Sources who chose to remain anonymous out of fear for the safety of themselves and their families have provided us with these two pictures depicting Alex Tilley's smug mug 'untouched' (left) and then 'airbrushed' (right) for the Tilley Socks packaging.
24,The socks have now been removed from their packaging.
24,It just occurred to me that the infamous nail-sticking-out-of-hardwood-floor could pose a serious health risk to even the most solidly constructed sock.
24,A single pair of socks worn daily without end means that they will have to be washed frequently.
24,... they claim to be and I quote 'Guaranteed to last 3 years.'
24,I was going to go on and on at great length about a number of things which have happened recently to prevent my continued devotion to my socks project.
24,The chant of a drunken band the pain of a broken heart; the city screams your name but you don't know who you are.
24,It's been over a month and a half since the first wear so it's definitely about time they get a decent review.
15,Over Spring Break my family went to Memphis.
15,Katlyn- Since you are so totally the coolest neighbor ever and I mention you in my blogs like every day I thought I would let the public know exactly who you are... Love ya ~Lauren~
15,Howdy Neighbors Well today I woke up at 7:00 am and went to the gym with Katlyn my buddy pal life support....she's just my best friend...not the other stuff....and i ate a carb smart bar before I went to the gym and now I have a stomach ache...which is fine...I'll live... Other than that my mom is taking my brother to a movie..and she says ' I never spend time with him...' which I find hilarious because the last time we had a girl's day out was like before my little brother Jack (4) was born.
15,My mom so totally wouldn't let me put a pic of my permit because she's freaked that my driver's license number is on it so i can't put it on there... sorry kids.. i know you just wanted to see it badly love everyone... wear your seatbelts stay off the meth.
15,I'll take a picture of my hair later...

16,Today.. life is like study go out study for me.. go church stress abt hw.. sumtime its like wat da point hey n yes i always got sumfin to complain abt according to trung neway.. life jus fly soo fast.. and now im stuk.. in dis mess wondering.. wat is goin on.. im soo confused....i was wondering like wat am i g0in to do abt this thing goin on..the subject.. its him..he...he is like so sweet n gentle.. but doesnt say much... i like him but i duno if i like him enuf i mean like wat if i make da mistake to let him slip by.. but wat if i make da mistake to hold on to what ive got too tightly.
16,alright sum1 beta read diz coz it weird if no 1 does... hallo ne one out there i finish exams today yall do jap.. huahuahuah me jon trish went ct today me try on dresses um..... goin out to celebrate tonite latahz
34,i give up nothing i can say or do will impact our relationship i feel like yelling from the highest peak please hear me please listen i notice my voice travels around his head without ever entering his ears i can repeat myself over and over two feet from him and he doesnt hear me he will see the tears in my eyes and never see that he caused them he will cause my heart to break and just step over the pieces he will sleep and play and never offer to lift a finger to help he will sit and stare at the television but only takes notice of me when i am naked i am nothing to him but a pair of tits and a pussy he doesnt know me doesnt see me doesnt hear me i see him i hear him i know him i want him to at least attempt to know me to hear the things on my mind to see the things that touch my heart i am nothing to him and he is everything to me i give up i cant reach him i give up i am done
34,how can i love him so much and hate him a tenth of a second later i want to strangle him and watch his eyes bug out and then i want to hold him and snuggle up close he infuriates me i feel the blood start to boil within i long to connect with him like we used to what happened to us three kids new job weight gain weight loss new friends old problems i want my life back how it used to be when he was there for me when his homecoming elicited a smile now we hide from each other in the same house we are roommates who fuck basically we just happen to be married and are parents to the same children the emptiness between us is vast communication is non-existent it hurts deep down in my soul i wait with bated breath to tell him things he cant hear me or doesnt want to what do i do i try and fail and try something else i am drowning in loneliness and grief do i love him hate him or even care
34,there is a place not far from here where the only walls are the ones within people where new beginnings take place and old friends are seen where the sound of laughing children echoes all around a place where strangers smile when you walk by and even if they are paid to be nice you don't care because it just feels good to be around happy people the air is cleaner you come home so tired yet refreshed as if god himself breathed new life into you you are free to be exactly who you are you don't have to expose your weaknesses but you are free to if you so desire you walk around and notice that this place is so inviting the butterflies seem to dance as they travel from each flower as if they know that this place is the only place they want to be the stars at night seem to shout your name bringing a sense of calm to your soul the moon in its brilliance beckons you to savor each second that you spend in this piece of heaven when you leave all you want to do is run back to the safety of innocence to the calling of truth to the friendly people who greet you with smiles on their faces and love in their hearts but that is not your reality for one week of the year you make the trek the rest of the time you are stuck here in oblivion away from that one place you'd rather be
25,My sister and Daylin just found out the sex of the baby....and it is going to be a boy I'm so excited I can't sit still.

25,you read that right I am working a Friday.
25,Oh life has me by the seat of my pants these days.
25,So I think I am finally back on California time.
25,Okay so I got tired of UJournal having issues.
14,Well the past few days have been very active for me yesterday I went too my nans house with my brothers girlfriend and did the gardening for them which was... interesting then we went home I sat on the computer then I was beckoned by my mum so I lay outside on the hammock and my uncle phoned so me and my dad went fishing with him.
14,I'm going too start my new graphics website tonight I'm going too try and make it look as professional as I can but I'm not sure what too do the design like Its going too Include my Wallpapers Avatars Signatures Posters and logos that I have made for people and for myself its going too be sort of like a portfolio about my work.
14,Well as you may know i'm not enjoying the holidays at all I can't wait just too go outside too the shop or something its not enjoyable sat inside all day its the most boring thing that you can do my Computer is no longer an amusement too me.
14,Today has been the most boring day of all the holiday I woke up at 12 and went on the computer at 2:30 i went and watched a program about immigrants then at 3 i went and got dressed and came back onto the computer.
14,Well i'm happy now At last yesterday I was really depressed for some reason about an old ex-girlfriend that i really miss Anyway thats in the past Last night I got home from a party and stayed up all night on msn It was a great laugh i spoke too people like Wacky and Marissa :p hehe Today I just basically went too Bourton on the Water and we went and had a meal then went to 'Birdland' i had an interesting paddle in the river It was brilliant in birdland i actually started screaming like a monkey at some parrots they seemed too enjoy it Then further around i saw a cockatoo that was on its own in the cage and was trying too get attention by nodding up and down but it sounded really lonely so we stroked it Then of course we had the interesting journey home With my impressions and things This brings me too here where I am on the PC doing my blog (mr. hypocritical).
14,Well life for me isn't that good my family is wicked yeah but its the people in my village that I hate there are people who are after me because they hit me and broke my nose Its just dumb All i'm doing is either skating playing guitar sitting on the pc or playing on my xbox I need too go outside I feel restricted as if there is a barrier outside my door I only feel good when i'm doing skarz i'm not sure why its just the feeling that I get as the adrenaline pumps through my blood when I do something outrageous it feels good i'm not sure how too explain the feeling its just like a rush a 'natural high' its the feeling you get when you land a trick for the first time on a skateboard or complete something you've been attempting too do for a while.
14,I got rid of wallpapers off of my site I felt that there was no significance for wallpapers nobody would download them anyway so I just felt that it was a waste of space.
14,These past few weeks we've been starting too get some decent footage and with the new site up we now have more publicity and simon is getting much better at editing his footage.
14,Well my last four days have been alright I suppose i've always been with my mates since the last time I wrote in this blog I have watched shit loads of the flash movies and played the games on albino black sheep unknown geek and newgrounds.
14,Wellllll as some of you may know I had another interesting all-nighter with the likes of Marissa it was very interesting found out some stuff that I didn't know and told people some stuff that they didn't know its was great I stayed up waiting for my mate to come round and the bastard came round to late (He gave me a funny look then called me a 'Paed' cause I made a typo) Then we went on the PC went on the ps2 and i fell asleep for two hours ate my dinner then we went to the shop bought red bull And we're here...
14,This weekend I just sort of went too St. Ives in Cornwall the 4 hour journey there is always boring but when we get there we usually go to the pub which is nice.
14,Well today I just did the usual woke up and went on the pc after throwing stuff on my sleeping friend of course as you do.
14,I've had such a good weekend so good in fact that I haven't even had too fill in my blog Its been wicked Saturday morning I went too work and concreted a load of floor then made it level.

26,It's been raining the whole day... made a wise choice of working from home Haha... and hey I did accomplish something ok Working from home certainly has its perks sometimes The only thing is I've been hogging the broadband modem... (no I don't have a wireless router) and my poor siblings didn't get to surf the net for the whole day.
26,It's quite funny to read all those blogs on the web.
26,Congrats Your a Pure Angel Angels as far as most of them go are all compatabile creatures but Pure ones simply are symbols of God.
26,Strike up the band let it play Love songs to haunt me and I'll stay But when it comes to a waltz Both words and music will ring false For you waltzed in And spun my world Around in dizzy dance I swirled But suddenly You waltzed away from me Those violins they must go So no careless hand with a bow May play on the strings of my heart And make me remember how lovers part How you waltzed in And spun my world Around in dizzy dance I swirled But suddenly You waltzed away from me Strike up the band let it play Whatever it chooses and I'll say Play me a waltz if you will I'll sit here and listen waiting until My love returns To take my world And spin it 'round In dizzy swirl Where girl loves boy And boy loves girl And feet don't touch the ground ~~~~ 'The Waltz' Silje Nergaard
26,My little cousin who comes to my place everyday is down with chicken pox... after being in contact with my brother most of the time last 2 weeks... (yes.. my brother was down with chicken pox) and my mum told her she can't go home because her mum is pregnant.

26,Just the other day I saw 2 primary school boys smoking and swearing.
26,You're Most Like Charlotte You're fanciful and wishful and your friends just adore you.
26,“Aiyo Jillian how come u look like an auntie when u are only so young For goodness’ sake wear some make up la” This was what a MALE customer of mine said to me one day.
26,It used to be this way.
26,Hehehe... was reading tech news and came across this article in www.asiacomputerweekly.com.
26,Woh... found out that 2 of my friends are pregnant over the last 2 days... guess this is the 'IN' thing now when we are all about that 'getting hitched and child bearing' age... Incidentally I saw 2 very different scenarios in the 2 friends' pregnancy.
26,I've been confined 12 days already.
25,But there are a couple of things I've been thinking about.
24,Currently most of my time is thrown away staring at the internet.
24,I just signed up for this thing and I can't see my own blog.
15,Well it's me again....of course (Nee-cole) Well Friday I had five friends come over and hang out for a while.
15,Hello to all and how are you Well of course this is Nee-cole.
15,Well it's Nee-cole again it looks like I will be doing all the writing but he will tell me happened in his day or week or whatever.
15,Hello to all Well this is acually Nee-cole writing b/c Mike (Josephine) is too lazy to write....so I am going to tell you about his day.
16,Yes i survived not eating for 24 hours I am glad I don't live in a 3rd world country.
16,i'm gonna work on my around the world today and hopefully get half of the paper done.
16,i promise that we won't have school tomorrow which gives me time to work on around the world.
16,Just got out of school hopefully there will be no school tomorrow so i can work on my paper and go to the famine.
16,got the board up now i got to see if people will sign up.
16,I got cut oh well guess I'm just gonna go get a job.
16,I am done with my chem project first to turn in the project also now i have to work on around the world planning on starting it on teusday not gonna take a while compaired the chem one.
16,Ralph if you really wanted to de-throne Bush you'de stay out and let my boy Kerry do the work but now you've made it just that much harder.
16,Can't play any tennis can't get up with Chris Wolla.
16,No practice off to work on the chem project.
16,Well it didn't rain like Clingerman said it did so i'm gonna go see if people are playing out at Tabor hopefully so but i doubt it.
16,Yeah that new Pic Squad CD is very good listen to number 6 9 and 15.
16,Tennis tryouts started i doubt I'll make it I got pounded today by some freshman
16,Well looks like 10 people are getting cut from the tennis team this year hope i'm not one of them but if i am I'll just go get a job.
16,1 Hour delays are cool unless you still have to do like 15 chemistry practice problems.
16,Ok listem to Laney Pope today she might have something accurate to say on account of the snow falling from the sky.
16,Still working on the chemistry project not that hard but still takes a long time (8 pages) I got $20 and a pocket knife for valentines.
16,Like I said don't count on snow.......stupid Laney Pope.
16,Hopefully there will be no school tomorrow but i wouldn't count on it last time WXII said 100% chance of snow we got nothing.
16,Ok nothing happened that was crazy except I chipped a back tooth oh and I actually figured out what we are doing in math.
16,So Daniel who do you want to win the election I get that question alot ok maybe not but stay with me here.

24,Sometimes i stand back and watch you With your fake smile and forced fashion Sickening sometimes as you're all talk and no action Trying way too hard at everything you do Cant handle the fact your being is inadequate You live to love and love to live in other's eyes Not being cool makes you cry Going as far as to take that social hit No one can see the real story on the inside Afraid if they do the charade will be over Then maybe you'll grow up and feel older Wishing only one would figure out whats in your mind The latest single by a faceless band Gotta have it gotta get it livin up to the status whore Gettin tired and disgusted cant take it no more Practiced at it so long you know it like the back of your hand
24,You say its worth something But its hard to define Runnin around something simple Slicing that line Dissected till it fractures Delicate system malfunction Disgust is in the air waves Choking on something There was a time when Answers 'n questions seemed the same Absence of sense cut right up Ignore the meaning and call it by name For all the times i tried You can take it with you when you leave For all the times i lied You can take it with you when you leave For all the times the foundation died You can take it with you when you leave For all the ways it makes me blind You can take it with you when you leave Trendwhore accomplices Mashing the barrier from real to fake Narcotics till you're numb Costs too much to eat your cake Soldiers with no souls Fighting the empty battles of the mind Take the reigns and lead yourself to pain You're in the spotlight and on you i must dine Theres a space between The things you know and the things you fear Erased memories i can feel but cant touch Holding back the martyr thoughts and tears For all the times i tried You can take it with you when you leave For all the times i lied You can take it with you when you leave For all the times the foundation died You can take it with you when you leave For all the ways it makes me blind You can take it with you when you leave

33,I dont know why i can't stop thinking about this man His actions have been criminal at the least.

33,well I think I mentioned it earlier.
33,well I found a potential offer.

33,Hi all its friday night and I'm tinkering with my computer.
33,I am closing on closing out the third week of work.
33,I have to say I am feeling to the point were I feel close to normal.
33,well today was another daY waiting for training.
33,tomorrow is my first day of work.
33,hey sports fans well I've completed my first month of work.
16,Today is another ordinary mundane day.
16,This is ridiculous It is already 1.50 a.m. in Melbourne and I'm still online Haha Yesterday went to Physics Lab to do experiment with Kiran.
16,Yesterday the Internet access was cut off.
16,Went to lecture for Maths 1 today.
16,Melbourne is such an unusual place compared to hot humid Singapore.
16,Singapore...at lastafter three months.Today went to Elim Church.
16,Today I finished the Literature and Physics papers...I honestly think I screwed up for the latter...anyway one more paper left.Maths 2 should'nt be a problem...tomorrow is a holiday.Can devote the entire day to Maths 2.
16,Today the Maths 1 lecture finally completed the whole syllabus for Semester 1.
16,This diary entry is in the third person.

16,Last Sunday I went to St James' Church.However it seemed that Jie Hui was rather caught up with a lot of work so she was unable to watch the movie with me.She had to prepare for a church playand also had to juggle her workload at VJC.It seems that VJC will stop at nothing to press its students to give it all the glory.How sad life is...nowadays S'pore is producing only 'hard disk drives'.It is apparent that A1s are like the life support systems for most of the friends I know.Goodness.If only they realised that Jesus Christ is the answer to all their needs instead of result slips that can perish.I just realised that without JesusI'm like a robot without the batteries plugged in.Of coursein Australia the situation is'nt so bad.It is far better to seek the Kingdom of Heaven first than all these results which will not get you anywhere.

24,Welcome one and all the site is active finally there has been a long hiatus between the first work I did on this new site this has mainly been due to contract and other commitments I have had.
24,Ignore the date and time on this post it’s a repost due to the fact that I have moved over to a blogger system Its 20:34 and I'm working on the website again lots more content now I'm reasonably happy with it.
24,Ignore the date and time on this post it’s a repost due to the fact that I have moved over to a blogger system Well its 22:52 in the evening and I'm still working on the design of this site I have just designed the main text section thus why I am writing this entry hopefully it will look ok but I'm not sure.
24,Couple of things in this post firstly the previous post contained a massive rant against alternative people that in hindsight could have been worded better.
24,Right it has been over a month since I last updated this site that’s fucking appalling although there are some extenuating circumstances.
24,I am ill no fuck that I am phlegm chokingly ill.
24,Finally moved into my temporary office well its basically a pre-fab building in the garden that will become a workshop after I have moved back out however it has power and a network connection so who am I to complain.
24,Well another day and another blog entry.
24,Ok well I have a few things to write about but I’m very tired been working most of the day and just watched ‘One Hour Photo’ which was a fantastic film also watched ‘Black Hawk Down’ for the first time yesterday but will write more about that later.
24,Ahh just at the tail end of a lush weekend for many reasons so let me explain.
34,Kevin and I will be leaving for our trip to England this Tuesday May 25th.
34,Well the school year has come to an end--I can't believe I won't have to set my alarm clock Sunday night It really seemed to go by quickly especially this semester.
34,Hello everyone I will try to post here as much as I can but I will make no promises I just have so much going on in my life that I can't keep up most of the time so I know other people definitely can't.
15,Sorry I didn't get to write yesterday it was a busy day.
15,Man today started out early I had to get up at 6:30 :p Now usually that wouldn't be considered early for me but with Christmas break happening I have gotten lazy and love to sleep in later that I would if school was in session.
15,Christmas break is a great time of the year ;) But even though I don't want to I have to go back to school on the 8th.
15,Hey what are you all doing I am not looking forward to going back to school.

24,Chris and I are expecting a baby I am only five weeks gone so it's early days yet I'm due in April.
24,Sorry I've been slightly busy over the weekend I came back to work yesterday but I had loads to do so I didn't have time to write.
24,I am sooo tired and so in need of a lie in.
24,Its Thursday I am tired again I didn't get my night in front of the telly as I planned yesterday we got a phone call at tea time and it was my father in-law asking us out for a drink so we went out for a couple.
24,Chris really enjoyed his first day in his new job he says it's very relaxing because he's not the manager.
24,What a day I've been so busy I don't feel like I've stopped all day.
24,Well Chris has started his new job for now he couldn't wait to get there.
24,He went for the interview this afternoon and he's got the job he starts tomorrow at 8am.
24,Chris has just phoned and told me that he may have a job to tide him over until a management position comes up at his old place.
24,Well Chris is still without a job but we are trying to stay positive.
24,Well I completed the Race for Life yesterday it only took us about 45 mins and I really enjoyed it it was really hot so I got slightly sun burnt but the great thing was that all the women were there for the same reason.
24,Well today seems so much more bearable Chris is still unemployed but relieved thet he hasn't got to go back to a job he really did not like.
24,Well things have not improved much we've had to cancell signing for the new mortgage but it's ok because we are able to put that off for six months.
24,Well they say it never rains it pours and they couldn't be more wrong at the moment.
24,I am doing the Race for Life this weekend for Cancer Research.
24,A little bored and still emotional from a bad weekend my Nan died on Sunday she's been ill for a long time so in a way it's a relief but it's still sad.
24,We were so upset last night We just couldn't believe we were out But that was just the beginning of my upset for the night Me and Chris walked home after the match we made it home for about 11 I sat on the door step whilst Chris had a fag and moaned about Beckham then I noticed a shape next to my scooter on the drive.
24,How mortified we were I went to watch the match at a friends house and we had so much hope (and beer) we were convinced we would win.
24,Work has been a complete nightmare over the past few days.
24,Is tuesday I've had a long weekend and a mad one.
24,I am so tired today I could just fall asleep here and now and possibly sleep for a week.
24,I'm sorry I've not posted for a bit.
24,Right now I have time I'll update you on what's been going on.
24,Not exactly planned but we are both over the moon we can't quite believe it yet.
26,Well just finished attending my dear university's annual political theory conference.
26,Some old high school buddies of mine made a listserv for us all and one of my friends shared a dream she had asking if anyone wanted to take a crack at analyzing it.
26,Generally speaking when folks think of my dear university Texas A&M University they consider it to be a rather conservative (if not hick redneck) sort of place.
26,THE JOYS OF TEACHING I suspected at the beginning of this semester (this is my first teaching gig) that there would be a problem and I was correct.
26,WELCOME ALL Having seen a few other folks do this I figured I should stop my Luddite ways and join in the blogosphere.
26,While there are many thinks to chat about I did want to get to this - the curious case of the IHOP conspiratorialist.
26,to cancel a lecture this has to be my favorite.
26,Students are not fond of exams (adendum - students not hopped up on mind-altering drugs are not fond of them).
26,So don't say you weren't warned.
26,Just a couple notes for the dear readership on things to come random statemtents etc.
26,There's this group at Notre Dame [current dwelling place of my dear heart] called the Erasmus Institute and they offer money/fellowships/etc.
26,I must admit to being a bit out of sorts today.
26,This morning has come with sad news.
26,Cna only write for a moment (about to head to Mass) but did want to share something with you.
26,...perhaps I am too hard on the Flyers.
26,It appears that once again my dear alma mater the University of Dayton has disappointed on the basketball court.
26,I am happy to annouce that there is yet another blog hitting the scene.
26,This is a bit of a hectic week.
26,Figure I'll get this out of the way now.
26,It has been a good time recently indeed.
26,'Grrrr....varm-fuzzy nice-nice...vhat's the point of science if no one gets hurt' 'Look at you with your vorld peace and your moccasin-valking and your potpourri You're not mad scientists You're just a bunch of hippies' --both said by super-villian Chromedome attending the annual Mad Scientists' Fair in The Tick (Episode: 'Tick vs. Science').
26,Okay thanks to assistance from the Dude Dear Heart and my good friend West Coast Computer Genius I now have some links up.
26,I was just chatting with a fellow I am friends with (a hard-core Calvinist theorist with an office across from mine).
26,I have a tendency to say 'there's always time.'
26,I realized today that I rarely if at all have discussed theology here yet.
26,Well last night in dear Aggieland apparently we had a concert.
26,A slight digression from the plane experience.
26,Well just finishing off a nifty weekend with dear heart at Notre Dame but as with all things under heaven there are no unmixed blessings.
26,....and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.'
26,Well before getting to work today thought I would put down a little message.
26,Well pulled yet another all nighter....making this two in three days.
26,Since she was just mentioned a little more.
26,Okay one thing has come to mind (along with this self-observation that my writing is like my chess: completely reaction-oriented).
26,The taxes are sent in the chapter draft sent of to da boss the seminar stuff completed and finally the comments/counter stuff is up.
26,One more thing - if you haven't done so yet please look through our fine variety of links.
26,Figured I'd add this while I was thinking of it.
26,Okay here's the thing - I'm at the office late trying to get a dissertation chapter done among sundry other things.
26,I do hope all of you had a good Easter on this the holiest time of the year.
26,I was in the car yesterday and by free association a memory came to mind thanks to a Sting song (hey the rock station was playing junk so it was either silence or the '80s-90s-and-today' station).
26,Okay so some nights ago I am at the BoC having a Bock reading a little St. Thomas Aquinas .
26,One of my legion of readers ('legion' here defined as 'any number greater than zero') sent me an email today asking why there's no email link on this blog.
26,My mom sent me an email recently (sent by someone she knows at church) dealing with the niftiness that is Indianapolis (or as a dude from Detriot I met down here called it 'Nappytown.'
26,'Dark is the suede that mows like a harvest.'
26,As Garfield would say 'Mondays suck.'
26,Yes The last real lecture for my first semester teaching is DONE Oh smell the sweet aroma of freedom Huh....oddly enough it smells like dust slowly collecting on all the work that I haven't done.....but we're not going to think of that right now FREEDOM
26,Sorry for my lack of posts in recent days - with the end of semester I'm realizing that not only the students but the profs also suffer much at this time.
26,Well I had planned on writing something funny but alas all-nighter exhaustion hit a little faster than I expected today so instead I wager I share something on my mind as late.
26,For many folks now is the time of writing term papers and completing final exams.
26,I have thought about the future.
26,So naturally after going off like that one of the computer guys shows up pretty soon and helps me out.
26,Well it's been a couple days.
26,That is of course if you can see my blog (I at the moment cannot).
26,This is a trick....I'm trying to get better about writing at least something each day but I'm not sure what to add.
26,Thankfully the more destructive storm elements (hail lightning tornadoes etc.)
26,Two things have come to my attention recently and I ask you all to keep those involved in your prayers.
26,Well it is a rainy day here in Aggieland - an odd rainy day really.
26,All right - yet another one for y'all for a grand total of 16 cool points.
26,Well finally got the grading done last night....just in time to head into the school today to hand out final exams so yet more stuff to grade.
26,Before I head out tonight (and this will probably be a once-a-week thing from now on) thought I'd point out some books and such that have recently caught my attention and wallet.
26,Everything's bigger in Texas so the line goes.
26,Well looks like I figured it out.
26,Having said all that this new template stuff (which looks a bloody lot more complex than the old one) frightens and confuses me.
26,Well as you can see the blog is looking a might different now.
26,'Objection' is an overly-used term in legal language.
26,Since I am leaving for Portland soon and am running a great deal farther behind than expected I'll be doing something a little different for most of the week.
26,....as well as those of you wearing clothes today is an important day.
26,So I'm searching this blog's title (because I am dreadfully affirmation-seeking that way) and I ran into this alexa.com page that apparently had some rating for the site.
26,Just when you think it's safe to be nerdy something comes along.
26,That's not quite true - we actually have a rather easy-going life.
26,I understand that sometimes it is necessary to bring your kids to the workplace.
26,I'm afraid I can't write much today - just came in to check the email and all.
26,The blogosphere is Berlin in the late eighteenth century.
26,...just thought I would direct you to some of the new links from the last few days.
26,In less than 24 hours I shall be flying my way to Portland for a three week seminar on ethics and international relations.
26,....and how little productive work is done.
26,Well things have been a little off today (up waaaaaaay too late last night thanks to some nasty storms paying the rent today etc.)
26,Once there was a man named Smitty All he wanted was three-fifty But along came Nessie and things got messy So now Smitty's dead what a pity.
26,As I was working I realized that I had to go through an online training course about discrimination in the workplace and so forth.
26,Well I had written up a nice little discussion on 'Talk Show on Mute' Philip K. Dick and Harrison Ford BUT (thanks to a lyrics page being a pain) it all just vanished into computer oblivion.
26,Yesterday the professor in charge of the seminar I'm taking suggested a big game of ultimate frisbee.
26,Can't write long (time for dinner) but the seminar stuff is going well and is interesting.
26,Greetings true believers from the land of rain and moistness I have arrived safe and sound and looks like things are going to be groovy here.
26,Yeah that's as hip as I get.
26,Was going to thrill you all with amazing stories dry wit humor and horror but alas nothing to report.
26,Well it appears I have managed to whittle down the true believers to about four now - I thank you for your high level of endurance.
26,...and I'm watching every one of you.
26,You can tell quite a bit about a person from his/her aspirations from when one can say 'I have 'made it'.'
26,As you can tell from the time I'm writing a wee bit earlier than normal today.
26,I need some helpful advice from the blogosphere.
26,For those of you with some time or just want to avoid work give this little aesthetic test a try.
26,Yeah yeah I know....I said yesterday that I was going to write something happier but this isn't as negative as the title sounds.
26,Well I just wrote that title so obviously I must think of something happy.
26,Terribly sorry for the lack of posts as of late (yes I can see you are all disappointed).
26,If I understand right 'bleg' is the term for 'blog begging' and that works here.
26,'...the dream of a universal society of purely spiritual essence is nought but the phantom of the City of God haunting the ruins of metaphysic.'
26,Sometimes things just don't turn out as you expect.
26,Lately songs and tunes get stuck in my head.
26,For those of the political mindset here are a couple links perhaps worth seeing.
26,As I probably will not have a chance to write anything of much substance today here are a couple links to some interesting stories/statements I've run into.
26,...on and on to other blogs.
26,Yes I am trying to make up for leaving things empty this weekend.
26,Sorry for the weekend's radio silence.
26,Just reading over today's quote I realized that it may not be the wisest one for me to post - that whole 'becoming an academic' thing and all.
26,'Not in feeling but in action is the good and ill of the reasonable social creature; even as his excellence and his failings are not in feeling but in action.'
26,'He got more pleasure from writing than the world ever got from reading him for his work was not amusing nor was he.'
26,Like I said not exactly in the best shape today so this may be today's last one.
26,'Admittedly it would be unfair to expect our political conventions to be showcases of candor and genuineness.
26,While there will be more up soon I must admit to being exhausted.
26,Well as you can see there have been....issues with Blogger yesterday.
26,....then congratulations - hopefully that means things are improving.
26,'So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night.
26,'As for hobbies most people with stimulating hobbies suffer from the most noxious of despairs since they are tranquillized in their despair.'
26,'In order therefore that the social pact should not be an empty formula it contains an implicit obligation which alone can give force to the others that if anyone refuses to obey the general will he will be compelled to do so by the whole body; which means nothing else than that he will be forced to be free for such is the condition which giving each citizen to his country guarantees that will not depend on any person.'
26,'But it is not so where wrong is done to any particular person by a multitude.
26,In the coming hours a review for Collected Miscellany and no doubt something else.
26,Sorry the last post's text is a bit small - it was either that and a normal looking page or have the text normal and the sidebar shoved down to the bottom of the screen.
26,'Notice for example in broadcasting the needlessness of exact timing the horror of silence.
26,'If we think of the object of the theory in separation from the theory we falsify it and fall into quietism or conformism.'

26,'There is not one human being who above a certain elementary level of consciousness does not exhaust himself in trying to find formulas or attitudes that will give his existence the unity it lacks. . . . As in those moving and unhappy relationships which sometimes survive for a very long time because one of the partners is waiting to find the right word action gesture or situation which will bring his adventure to an end on exactly the right note so everyone proposes and creates for himself the final word.'

26,Grading proceeding at an acceptable rate.
26,'...we live at a time when man believes himself fabulously capable of creation but he does not know what to create.
26,The syllabus is not just for students - make sure to read it yourself.
26,Thinking about the last few larger posts I notice there is at least implicitly a certain assumption behind what I've been writing.
26,'...we may observe that nothiong so clearly exposes the break-down of classical scientia as the deification of chance itself.
26,Just for regular readers (or those who will hopefully be so) August 11 and 12 will probably have few to no posts.

14,It starts with one... One thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down 'till the end of the day The clock ticks life away It's so unreal You didn't look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on Didn't even know I wasted it all Just to watch you go I kept everything inside And even know I tried It all fell apart What it meant to be Will eventually be A memory of a time when I tried so hard and got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter One thing i don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To remind myself How I tried so hard...

14,I slept for the longest time ever today guys.
14,My Old blog was getting old.
14,Sorry bout the no updates guys.
14,So well yestday hmmmm....I woke up and went to take my bro to the airport at like 10.
14,Well woke up shower then got ready then went to cousins.
24,I am a food addict to the core.
24,Weighed in at a whopping 218 at 7am.
24,The more memorable events of yesterday included me having no shame in purchasing a bunch of junk food from the gas station.
24,I wish I could have the confidence to say that I'm starting Saturday no excuses.
24,Clarification: From what I'm reading Medifast is just like Optifast without the doctor's fees.
24,Early yesterday morning I woke up miserable... wondering how exactly I would get out of this fat-fiasco I've found myself in.
24,The other day I had an interesting conversation with a friend.
24,This past week has been slightly stressful in that a dear friend of mine was in town and of course she wanted to go out to eat.
24,I never thought I'd be this happy to be in the 170s.
24,I'm just over 30 days into the program (thank goodness I'm losing count) and I'm now at 180 pounds I've NEVER lost weight anywhere near this fast before (although again I've never been anywhere near this big before).
24,There was a point yesterday where I was resigned to failure---I was about to eat again But I looked in the fridge and sure enough my shakes were already made and ready to drink so I was saved.
24,Yesterday I really did slip up--and I feel very ashamed.
24,I don't know what happened to my motivation.
24,So you won't lose it overnight Well that may be the case for some but I pretty much did gain my weight overnight.
24,Something is bothering me and now come to think of it it may not even be this program.
24,I'm lying here desperate to maintain control urging myself to move forward on the plan.
24,Although I wish it would move faster that averages to about 3.5 pounds a week.
24,Lately I've been putting a lot of thought into my maintenance plan and I guess it has me feeling kind of down because I have such a long way to go.
24,I woke up this morning and thought to myself ...'There is no way in hell that I'm going to get up out of this bed and go running...' And with that my pledge to run every day came to an abrupt end.
24,I noticed a definite slow down in my weight loss.
16,hmmm...SATs today...T-T totally hated the place i took it at...wtf...the desks were lyk fricken tiny.
16,u kno...i've never understood how people can pour all their thoughts and secrets into something lyk this...i guess there's alwayz sumthing new to learn...so here i am trying it out.

16,Hey there Yeaterday and today were awesome I got to spend a lot of time together with Jon (Merideth said it would be ok if I'd drive to Cici's with Jon since she was going in Josh's car w/ Ben) and so we all went to Cici's and ate pizza.
16,Ok my day today totally sucked First of all I had keyboarding in 1st block which always 'makes my day' then I didn't get enough sleep last night didn't have time this morning got my essay back in Modern Lit.
16,Today is one of my good days.
16,Josh and I dissected more of the pig today... it was gross (Gary kept on saying that over and over again) Merideth Erin and Matt made a funny scene about 'rushing the pig to the emergency-room' and stuff...I got it all on tape Just wanted to say this..........................
16,This is a day I do not want to live again... although there were some good things about it.
16,(This is what we learned today in youthgroup...)(yea I'm bored that's why I am typing).
16,Hello there the angel of my nightmare... ok I'll stop with that song...but I LOVE it (Blink 182 'Miss you') (No not just because it's 'our song' (Jon's and mine) hehe... Today was a pretty good day.

16,Hey there and Good morning my cookie (tasty...hehe) I just woke up and spent about an hour in the bathroom taking a loooong bath (well and I was having breakfast in the bathtub it's fun you should try it sometimes...) (what is not fun though is if the crums fall into the water and stick to your skin... that's kind of nasty) But alright I didn't come down here into the basement to write about crums sticking to my skin (and they're off anyways not sticking there any more)...
16,'What's wrong babe what's wrong ...I love you I love you...you know that right' - I know...and I love you too

16,Grandma Grandpa and I were at the beach and there were some stupid guys on the way back that were sitting on a bench (I was going back to the house before my grandparents they were still at the beach) and they said (in Hollandish or whatever language they speak it's very similar to German so I understood it) 'Woman hey woman do you have fire' and I shook my head and said 'No sorry' because even if I would have had fire I wouldn't have given them any (I didn't so it doesn't make a difference... what would I need fire for anyways) and then they tryed it again because they probably thought that I just didn't understand them or something in English (veeeeerry bad English it sounded kind of like 'Have you got fire' or something like that) and they were joking around and calling me woman again and then I lost my temper and yelled at them 'No I don't have any fire' and they shut up and left me alone.
16,PRAISE THE LORD I GOT MY PERIOD (I'd never have thought that I'd be so happy about that) (now I don't need to talk to my mom about it =) ) (hehe)

13,Hello and welcome to our blog.
13,i thin the hobbit is a truly fascinating book i has taken me a while to read it but i really enjoyed it Ms Cassidy has but in a lot of hard work to get alll this work done and she deserves a good holiday the hobbit is a really good fanstasy and science fiction book it has a great deal of suspense and is enjoyable to read
13,my fav character is Elrond because he's kool.
13,So far i think that The Hobbit is an interesting story but that the author used too many complicated sentences.
13,my favourite character was bilbo because i thought he was the character that made the book a bit exciting.
13,my fav charachter was ummmmmm gandalf because he bouhg ta lot of magic into teh book and yeah he s also from the book seems very nice thankyou
13,My Favourite character was Gandalf because he brings alot of magic into the story which is rly interesting.
13,I thought that all the characters from the Hobbit were clearly discribed.
13,Now that everyone is online we can get started Firstly remember I expect at least one post a week from each of you.
13,my fave charactor was bilbo because he is the hero of the book
13,um the hobbit i think starts of slow gets better then slows down again.
13,i tink the hobbit was bad and it was boring i nearly fell asleep
13,I think we've established that a lot of the class found The Hobbit boring I'm glad to see some of you took the time to tell me why you found it boring as well.
13,it is pretty descriptive but that was the style of writing wen it was writen like 50 years ago.
13,I thought the hobbit was a very detailled book so far this can get pretty boring but there has been some pretty exciting parts
13,the hobbit was ok but pritty borring
13,the hobbit was ok it was pretty slow at sum places
13,The hobbit was pretty good i was a bit slow at the start but it was really good during the middle.
13,this was alright but too detailed it was exciting at some points maybe in chapter 4 with the trolls and stuff but otherwise i found myself reading the same lines over and over again because it was either too descriptive or boring orrrelevent or weird writing style.
13,the hobbit was fairly good but it istoo discriptive
13,the hobbit was ok. it took a while to get into the book but at about the 3rd chapter it started to get interesting.
13,i didnt like the hobbit because it was sort of boring and some of the parts just dragged on and on and on and on.
13,SO TRUE HUGH TO LONG AND DETAILED
13,this book is bad it is too detailed.
13,The hobit was an alright but at timz it was overly descriptive which dragged on for a bit.
13,i tink de hobbit ws krap.
34,I just noticed the Ads by Google banner at the top of the page which had picked up on Rich and Lisa's friendly discussion on the merits of woodwind instruments.

13,i'm talking to a new friend of mine.
13,the only constant thing in the world is change...what an irony...what a reality....
13,i just read lyle's blog and all i could say is that i don't have a chance.
13,someone passed away today... katrina villaroman was reported dead early this morning.
13,i wonder why God is testing my loyalty to my friends these days... just yesterday i received this letter from my ex-kabarkada stef.
13,Reality bites Who ever said it didn’t [Try Barbie] I guess the Matrix saying is true.
13,'hey' hello i missed you... 'you're going here' yep can't wait... 'screw them' yeah screw them... 'i'm always attracted to girls with glasses' 'you're just saying that' i hope not... 'i think i'm in love' i am... with you... 'you're so wise' anytime my friend... 'so i'm the 'normal' guy in this fucked up school(sorry for the swearing)' aww... 'i'm the opposite of your statement' 'opposites attract' yeah they do... 'i'm telling you don't be' ok i won't rebel... 'move in with me' sure...'apartment or house' any as long as i'm with you... 'now we have a lot in common' i hope so... 'yeah' such a simple answer gives so much affirmation... 'i feel so special' because you are... it's almost been a day since i read his last message and i still feel this weakening adrenaline running through my veins.
13,i can't belive what i got myself into this time........ well needless to say i got caught..again.
13,i guess jammi is really in love with me...hihi
13,gosh....i can't believe i almost cried last night because of a broken heart broken again.
13,i had a blast yesterday tito cocoy brought us to libis to play badminton for an hour.
13,gosh everything is happening so fast i can't figure out what i should be feeling.
13,i was so irritated with daryl yesterday.
13,i'm so head over heels jammi is all i could ever ask for.
13,what do you say when someone you like says 'i'm falling for you.'
13,gosh i feel so guilty about ranting about my own stupid life.
13,i remember my parents telling me falling in love was caring for someone so much.
13,wow the UG community isn't so bad.
13,gosh there are so many things i wanna do this summer.
13,so much for an ultra kilig summer.
13,i'm a bad girl..........all of a sudden i don't feel good about it.....not at all.....i feel sick.....i'm so sickening....
13,i'm so bad...and in love............kinda nice i must admit...... i lied to raxzeez or whatever his name is about my rudeness.
13,I am officially a very bad person…… no doubt about it.
13,the past 2 nights have been some kind if mild milestone in my life.
13,It has been days since I last talked to the guy I thought I loved.
13,man i dig my new highlights though when i told it to daryl it seemed that she didn't care.
13,a lot of things have happened lately.
13,where will ibe the day after tomorrow [hahaha] i had a great time with my grandma and my aunt the other day.
13,how come poeple never question what is common in a deeper sense that is.
13,this insecurity is getting to me.
13,One night I was pleasuring myself when all of a sudden I closed my eyes and that was something I don't usually do.
13,I got this concept from an anime show named gensomaden saiyuki.
13,oh my god....this is so rockin' yesterday jammi and i talked for the whole afternoon.
13,i can't believe this my uncle and i spent more than 2 hours together just by ourselves yesterdy and he still hasn't allowed me to talk to jammi.
13,'sometimes the hardest thing to see is yourself.'
13,gosh everything's too good to be true my folks finally approved of jammi calling me at home but mama's still gonna talk to my uncle.
13,i'm having a great day first i was able to remember to bring lunch so i'm a little closer to buying my own guitar.
13,turns out that ms. balonkita isn't so bad considering the lecture we had this afternoon.
13,is it possible to love something you regret up to now i can't believe that jammi and i are no longer a couple.
13,I am Alexandria Krystel S. Sese a child of Roberto G. Sese Jr. 37 years of age and Carissa S. Sese 36 years of age.
13,i've been such a mess lately that i haven't noticed some of the better things in life... my brother seems to be having a really good time in college.
13,'to err is human to fogive is divine' mrs. dela cruz said that earlier.
13,i had a nice day... i figured my day would really be nice if i said so... heehee... i've just realized that thewhole day i didn't talk about jammi.
13,it hurts to realize that in exchange for the supposedly best days of my life i have to give up something some moments.
13,hijune 10... i never thought HS teachers are going to be frank with reality already.
13,i had a pretty nice day today... i'm glad i'm making new aqcuaintances while keeping close touch to old ones.
13,the first day of the schoolyear is almost over.
13,my soul tells me i am dreaming and so my body agrees i feel that this is bliss in closed eyes and if consciousness will keep me from this moment then in eternal sleep i shall stay if to slumber forever is to pass on then to death i shall surrender... those lips and eyes possessed by an angel with the touch of feather and the breath of breeze with the warmth of spring the thrill of summer I fall for you my soul is pulled out of me to you as if it was all meant to be under the gloomy skies and chilling wind I long for you… A kiss will end this anxiety And start a new moment A kiss will suffice for this day’s desire One contact will let me die And fall to the deepest It shall drive to chaos with peace The kiss will be the first..
13,i am now convinced that human's can be sick by nature.
13,i couldn't help thinking about my chat last night with jammi.
13,is it just me or jammi i don't get it why i just can't miss him the way i missed JP.
13,july 17 this day tunred out so much better than i thought.
13,i had a pretty nice day... jammi called last night.
13,now i won't have any problems with jammi because i don't have to talk to him anymore.
13,finally my urge to tell jammi i love him is gone.
13,it was prechi's birthday the other day and today we went to celebrate it in McDonald's.
13,i haven't talked to jammi in two days now.
13,i found it so hard to concentrate in school the other day.
13,i can't believe jammi and i just did what we shouldn't have we both found it weird actually.
13,tito cocoy and i went to watch a movie today.
13,just earlier this day i was watching my friend carla playing her guitar not knowing a couple of hours later i'd have my own.
13,this day couldn't suck any more than it did... fisrt i found out that the badminton club of our school is totally useless.
13,today was our math and pinoy exams.
13,these past few days have sucked like hell i don't know what's been up with me and why i'm so worked up.
13,this week had been so hectic for the past days i haven't been able to eat lunch at the right time because i had to stay in the library to do my research for our religion project which seems to be some kind of mini-thesis.

33,Fuck sake I hate blogger sometimes.
33,Ok I think I got it right.
33,Ooo ahh I wonder if this one still works...
33,Well I'm glad I came to my senses.
33,There finally got this journal looking the way I want it.
33,I was just re-reading what I wrote yesterday and I realised it sounds kind of bad especially where I said 'I don't care that much' right after saying everythings gone to hell.
33,Eesh everything's just gone all to hell.
33,Fucking hell it's freeeeezing in my office.
33,I totally think it's possible women think about sex more than men do.
33,Wow haven't written here in a while.
33,Oh my fecking head is killing me.
33,So I made this journal a bit more public.
33,I decided that this just isn't a blog until I've done one of those personality-type quiz thingies.
33,Moved this blog to a new folder.
33,Spent a bunch of time moving my public blog to use gm software.
33,On the S&N forums I posted a bunch of writing exercises in the creative section and I think I'll do one here.
33,Well I gave up on using blogger for my project.
33,Chalk another fecking reason to get totally irritated with blogger.
33,I wonder if this thing has stopped being a pain.
33,So I typo'd on an article on my work website.
33,At what point do I step back from certain family members and say 'Hey I'm a grownup now you have to stop trying to run my life.'
33,Still no word from the bellydancer.

33,Today I will get my work done and I will swim.
33,Love love loved Pirates of the Caribbean.
33,So I've got a vague story idea I'm kind of excited about.
33,Lately online I've been feeling ignored.
33,I really want to do a roadtrip out to Cali this fall or if worse comes to worse next spring.
33,Ohh I'm getting a nice little tan from all this swimming.
33,Well I had a whole blog written earlier today but like an idiot I closed the wrong window and lost it all.
33,I'm diggin' the scrolly bars on here :) I'm so clever.
33,Well my grandad is back home now and he looks great - tho my granny will not let him nap in his chair anymore :) Which has in turn meant that he sleeps great at night.
33,I really meant to update this sooner Leigh I swear it :) So this blog's for you ;) It's been a busy week.
33,So here I am blogging away on a Friday morning.
33,What is the fascination men have with breasts I wonder.
33,I just got the coolest program called 'Starry Night Backyard'.
33,Another truly MTV moment with Madonna snogging Britney Spears and Christina Aguilara.
33,I was about to go to bed but I feel so wretched I thought if I blogged I'd get it out of my system and be able to sleep.
33,MMmmmm Vacation... Today I turned in my request for a glorious week off in a few weeks.
33,Oh I curse the day I ever said I would do a site for a bellydancer.
33,sigh The kid (I'm going to have to come upwith a new nick for her since she's not really a kid anymore :( ) went to her first real dance last night.
33,Well while I wait for someone to send me some content for my little project I guess I'll blog a little.
33,I was in a meeting the other day with both bosses and the rest of the department and one of the bosses said we should start the meeting with a little icebreaker.
33,Ok so I'm becoming more and more impressed with Blogger's capabilities.
33,That would be the 'UK guy' from my last entry.
33,Have you ever been asked or thought about what it would be like to have a chance for a chat with your younger self What would you say to yourself - assuming you're now older and allegedly wiser.
33,This blog is dangerously close to becoming a 24 Blog.
33,I just want to say... 24... Gah I love it already.

33,Well it's not really a grind.
33,Packed off the sister the day before yesterday.

33,'Tis the weekend snow is finally predicted (3-5 inches) which is perfect weather to snuggle up with a good book/movie with a cuppa and just chill.
33,We nearly made it through the semester without getting sick.
33,And I can't think of a decent title for this entry.
33,Having said in an earlier post that I didn't feel the same overwhelming excitement to go see ROTK on opening day as I have for the last two films and that I would probably wait a day or two before going to see it I completely negated that statement by going to the midnight premiere with my daughter.
33,I love Google's little logos they occasionally use on their main search page.
33,Well that last entry was a bit of a downer eh Ah well it was my mood at the time.
33,My local Fox affiliate ran an editorial piece the other day during a commercial break that irritated the hell out of me.
33,So I'm thinking I need to take a class or something and learn how to fix my own car.
33,I think today was the crappiest birthday I've ever had.
33,Soooo blogger had an upgrade when I wasn't looking.
33,Looks like all I needed to kick my ass into blogging gear was a new look here hehe.
33,I hate the Gain corporation and all of the evil corporate greed they stand for.
33,I think someone's got a crush on me.
33,And I don't mean just blogging.
33,I have come to the conclusion that I'm not very patient.
33,At 18.30 on Tuesday the tube strike started it ended about 18.30 today.
33,It’s been sort of a strange couple of days.
33,It feels sort of surreal around here right now.
33,Stuff Its funny how you can go in one direction for awhile then all of a sudden do a complete 360.
33,Greetings Well today was supposed to be my final post-miscarriage check-up but as you might guess this isn't the case.
33,This weekend I was once again in Amsterdam and having been to the cinema to see Shrek 2 - I want a puss in boots - Monster and I went to watch the Holland-Sweden match in one of the pubs in the centre.

33,We all know that getting really really drunk just sucks—there’s no two ways about it.
33,Oh my good god I had to work today and boy did it suck.
33,Well not only is this my first contribution to the TCZ blog it’s also my first blog post ever.
33,How I learned to love to post and stop worrying about the Bomb.
33,It's freaking freezing in my office today.
33,If you know what the first part of the title means you've obviously played in a few poker tournaments :) Its a $30 buy-in tournament with 3 dollars going to the house.
33,Is summer over yet Am I a horrible mother for wishing that the kids were back in school I love my 3.

33,This was Matthew's birthday cake that Paul made for him:) As you can tell it was a Batman theme:) Jamie's birthday is coming up this weekend and it's a Harry Potter theme.
33,So this is the new blog eh Groooovy.
33,After a long few days of scanning editing creating sites and uploading - my pictures page is finally complete.
33,taps on the screen Is this thing working Seems to be thanks Melia So back to the title.
33,I'm all moved into the new place.
33,So I have my interview on Tuesday morning with the paper and my nerves are beginning to jangle.
33,I'm probably not adding this right.
33,God I'm in such a friggin HORRIBLE mood.
33,I usually am a strong opponent of tobacco.
33,Welcome to the second edition of 'Adventures with Kitties' starring Tigger as 'Little Bastard' and Pooh as 'Little Bitch' In today's episode it is early Monday morning and I've just gotten out of the shower.
33,Well since Melia just absolutley ADORES creating time consuming memes I'll just have to add my tuppence to this.
33,So last night I'm in bed reading a book when I hear Tigger start to howl really loud.
33,I've been pretty slack the past few months where exercise has concerned and every month when my bank statement comes I've been pondering what to do about my gym subscription.
33,When I was about 8 I like many other young girls wanted to be a nurse...but a televised eye operation soon put me off.
33,Every year we get a new group of interns - basically students who come to work with my group for a few months for job experience and a bit of money.
33,Sorry for posting again so soon but I feel a lot better about my dilemma and wanted to share :) A comment from my previous entry: Do you want to give that up for the extra money and less time with your daughter Well it's not that the new job would be the same as the one I have now.
33,I have a problem with my job.
33,Well today was full of surprises for me.
33,Figured I'd try my hand at these.
33,The weekend has been a rainy one in Switzerland so I decided to go about finally assembling the 5 dvd/cd racks that I bought a couple of weeks ago at IKEA.
33,So I just got back from a very relaxing stint outside the city which definitely did me some good.
33,Well ok that wasn't the question really these are the questions and like a sheep I follow with my answers ;) Grab the nearest coin and look at the date.
33,Um yey well I didn't know what to blog anyway so yey for random questions Here we go...
33,One interesting thing about Europe in comparison to the USA is how much more important vacation is considered to be in Europe than the USA.
33,There are a number of things I'm seeing that sort of weird me out.
33,Well might as well answer the latest set of questions as I always do...
33,I've been at a conference for the past two days and I wasn't really looking all that forward to it.
33,Grab the nearest coin and look at the date.
33,Well I seem to be into answering all kinds of weird questions the last few days so I don't know why this should be an exception.
33,So I kind of like answering these silly quiz questions.
33,Hidy Ho Good Neighbors:) How was everyone's weekend I feel like our's is still going because it's Tuesday and Paul is still at home:) I LOVE having my husband here at home:) I'm not ready for him to go back tomorrow.
33,Ah..so my last post did make it.
33,Ok my brain has been completely fried by today.
33,Well here's what's good in my life followed by a quick phone company rant So where did I leave off last time My grandmother is still hanging in there she'll be 97 next week.
33,Well at least for a little while.
33,OK so I've finally realised that i have to come to blogger to post not that I was trying hard I was in shock from not being able to use my computer in so long.
33,So I've been slacking in the TCZ posts I know.
33,Damnit all to hell and back.
33,Oh joy Rapture Today at 4:35am I stepped off the bus and back into vancouver.
33,Finally finally I have managed to get myself on the Blog.
33,Ok..its been ages since I last posted..or so its seems.
33,Its now a little after 2am on Sunday night and things are starting to quiet a bit at B10.
33,So here I am bloggin live from B10 Its only my second day ever in England but luckily the learning curve is not as steep as worried about :) The fun all started on Friday when I awoke at 3am after only 4 hours of sleep to drive to Zurich where I would meet Reethi and Sunshine and catch a flight to merry olde England.
33,Sometimes I might refer to my biological father Gary as Biodad when I'm talking about him.

15,Today I started cleaning up my room a bit....cleaning out drawers...going through old things.
15,Been sitting here doing nothing but listening to music.
15,God it feels like this day...well this afternoon will never end.
15,I said earlier that I just can't escape my thoughts...I can't escape myself.
15,Instead of posting one of my thoughts...I decided to post some of my favorite lyrics that I have written in my book... AFI.
15,( said in a whisper ) I met a man on the stairs.
15,Been sitting here for over an hour...listening to music..making stories in my head...like a movie I guess.
15,I was talking about writing reading and poetry with him earlier tonight..and I got in the mood to read what I've written...and I decided to post some (they suck..and I wrote them basically all in grade 8 or last summer but w/e) whispers turn to screams She sits inside this room alone knowing nothing is as it seems.
15,Its been so long since I've wrote something on here...I'm used to writing everyday..
15,I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hold The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I am still right here What have I become My ssweetest friend Everyone I know goes away In the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way
15,Kay seriously I have to make up my mind.
15,Actually this is a couple entries...some are very short....then theres one long one on my whole ReLiGiOn thing (if you know me you know how I am about the subject).
14,Blogspot I had come across this name before.
14,Really The next week was so full with tests and remedials and enrichments Finally it was the last lesson of the English Enrichment Thank god But he is coming back OH NO God.
14,I got a lot better when I reached home yesterday...It was a terrible feeling...your head was spinning and your fingers went numb.
14,Tuesday was once again here and over just as fast as expected.
14,Monday again Time is sure slipping away fast and I can't imagine the Napha test here the very next week It's my greatest fear the napha test.
14,Finally saturday had arrived And it's Daniel Radcliffe's birthday yesterday Happy birthday I'm in such a great mood lol.
14,Everything indeed had been going downhill since Monday.
14,Before you know anything time is slipping away above anything else.
14,I heard his hand flapping my bedsheets and I stirred to see a blurry figure.
14,I had no idea why but the days seemed to be getting worse day by day... Monday is all right.
14,It's tuesday once again Time is passing so fast as if the clock is set to work doubled the speed.
14,I really had no idea what is happening nowadays.
14,It's sunday but there's hardly anytime to relax.
14,God tell me oh tell me what to do..................................
14,It was a bright and sunny day...I got up early in the morning and prepared everything ready to go to school.
14,I don't know why... but since moral education lesson it had ruined my day partially.
14,After all the celebrations the four day holiday had finally come to an end.
14,I'm had never enter so many posts in one single day.
14,I'm so frightened so scared I dunno how she'll react.
14,I dunno That kind of Feeling That thoughts.. Of him I saw him every week Everytime charming as he is Though in reality He is not really that charming But in my mind He is One person is really charming His smile His eyes Filled with warmth and welcome with friendliness But I never spoke with him Never Another was another him One of a quiet sort Never does his homework Never that obedient Rebellious but smart I knew he is up to it It's just that he never did Confusing relationships are I never gave a thought whether they are true The topic the constant chattering Perhaps this will be over soon I knew I'm just being naive Just wishful just a little hopeful... Just don't want to give up this thought...
14,Friends.. Friends.. What are friends.. People who are always there They accompany you They're always there To talk to you To be with you To share your joy and your sorrow Your compliments And your tears I don't know who they are behind the mysterious masks they're never really there they're always gone before I ever found them Friends support they cheer you on They did But I don't ever know.
14,Happy 39th birthday Singapore It had been 39 years since our independence.
14,I don't know what had happened.
14,Thursday Time was passing slow enough I had to admit.
14,I remembered I had a very vivid dream today early in the morning.
14,It's Wednesday But time seemed to be passing so slowly... Something dreadful.
14,I really don't know what to do Everything is like...climbing a mountain At first we're getting fine and we're reaching the summit soon.
14,It's monday Monday means common test monday means another week of working.

33,Is that all we are worth these days Just wondering...
33,Well I've been an emotional mess today.
33,Well this is the 2nd posting of my blog.
33,Howdy... my name is Marianna & I live in Killeen.

33,Too bad I'm studying... but guess what I wrote my very 1st ever college paper WOOHOO I spent 4 hours this morning working on it and I think it looks pretty good so far.
33,I know you're looking at the calendar & thinking... hmmm she's lost her mind.

33,Is it after the 14th yet I'm about to BURST That's all... Ciao~ M
33,I may burst before this coming up weekend...
33,It's Sunday I've mowed my lawn I have 2 midterms coming up to study for... yet I feel like I'm on top of the world I know what you may be thinking... has the girl really just lost her ever-lovin mind I feel like I could conquer anything that comes at me including those 2 finals this week.

33,I have to blog about 3 things I've learned about this Introduction to Internet class I'm taking.
33,Ain't that a country song Ohhhh but how much I believe it today I feel like singing at the top of my lungs (which trust me... it's not pretty... lol)... but I'm in a good mood thanks for my wonderful situation

15,hehe...i'm sorry this really is my last entry for the day but i wanted to get this out of my sorry-ass mind...I really don't know what to do about this whole man-person situation...i don't want whats going to happen to happen...but then thats just me i guess cause no one seems to agree with me about it these days.
15,I found myself in a interesting situation and thought i should just let everyone know that i am a phsyco and usually only really amazing kisses feel like this I was talking to a friend who has never kissed anyone before and he asked me 'what does a kiss feel like' and basically this was the conversation.

15,haha i'm addicted its official oh well AAANYWAYS i think that the situation i am in right now is utterly rediculous and i really shouldn't be thinking about this certain person anymore because it is going to make things worse trying to convince either myself or anyone else for that matter that anyhting is going to work but besides that...i am going to try my hardest to not hitnk about love right now i'm talking about going out with someone hooking up with people all that shit.

33,Well I've been in the job a whole week and I can honestly say ....
33,Cream is currently trying to persuade me that we need to visit Egypt again ... not sure personally ...
33,I think we have a poltergeist in the house We bought four bottles of coke ... it was a treat for Cream ...
33,No ... it's not what you think ... Mum has not been dining with Hannibal Lector again.
33,I am a little fish again ... after years of doing my job ... now being able to do it with my eyes shut and one hand tied behind my back ...
33,Wednesday afternoon at my workplace a person was deprived of his freedom and placed in a confined space.
33,Well a bit of excitement at work today ... One of the prisoners went into a violent rage (nothing out of the usual) ... tore his cell to pieces (does happen sometimes) ... managed to break out by climbing into the roof space & air ducting (now that is original and inventive) So all exits were locked and we duly waited for him to pop his head out of the air-conditioning vents.
33,Flicking channels ... 'The weather is expected to' .... 'What if God was one of us' ....'Doh' ..... 'The Lib Dems have done well in the elections' .. so I stop flicking thinking Dad will be pleased and see an old face from the past staring at me from the screen standing next to Kennedy Had to take another look but sure enough there he was a little larger than I remember from University days ... (but who am I kidding ... like I'm still a size 8) but nonetheless still the same face Gets you to thinking ... what you can do with your life ... beginning to wonder now ... should do something with my life ... Ok .. so I am a Samaritan ... all well and good ... giving back to the community ....
33,Well back to the chocolate in my hand ... Have decided to take Vertigo's advice ( see comment to Blog doesn't revolve around you ) and put it in the fridge.
33,This morning I went down to Gladstone Park tennis courts and played tennis with Goliath.
33,It has come to my attention that my blog is being abused by certain individuals (ie Vertigo and Goliath) as a tool in their vendetta against one another ... Now surely this is not fair to taint such a work of art with petty squabbles Now it certainly may be that Visa Vertigo's husband (the self-proclaimed Enforcer)may also have a hand in this .... Dejanari is worryingly quiet too.
33,Sometimes I fear that no-one is actually reading my blog ...
33,I should be happy today ..
33,Went down to the park tonight to feed the geese moorhens ducks swans and all the chicks and cygnets ...
33,Decided on my maximum offer on the property above my head ... told her I had two choices ... raise the money she wants (way above what it is worth) and be financially broke OR await her lease extension where she would have to pay all my solicitors fees and just rake in the money.
33,OK ... so you have met one woman and her blog ... and a couple of related creatures ...
33,Well let me tell you a story ... always wanted to present Jackanory Anyhow ... Let me explain the last entry.
33,I have inspired Vertigo to keep a journal ... She is going to be capturing classic family one liners and memorable events.
33,Sister has now arrived on the scene.
33,OK ... now I am scared ... have mentioned my blog to my blessed brother who will no doubt post some rude comments or do something strange with it.
33,As always when I have a million and one things to do it is always easier to find another task which is completely unrelated to my mission for the the day ... which means I can genuinely explain all the hours I have spent not doing the task at hand.
33,Had a great evening BBQ ... family turned up ... with a couple of additions ... no they weren't crazed blog readers ... just Goliaths in-laws.
33,Well ... a little update for you ... no sign of idiot number 1.
33,OK ... Before Goliath Vertigo Visa and Cream post answers to the above question .. its rhetorical But there are some real stupid people on this earth Idiot number 1: Accosts my husband on the doorstep asking whether we are selling our property.
33,I learnt a valuable lesson today ... never try to come between a cat and a mouse.

33,'Is it true though that the male point of view is not being represented In a study of more than 1200 headlines from seven high circulation Canadian newspapers women were referred to as victims of violence thirty-five times for each one reference to men as victims.3 Not a single article focused on men.4 Compare this to the reality: Men are three times as likely to be victims of murder twice as likely to be victims of non-domestic violence and equally as likely to be victims of domestic violence but the study found that newspapers virtually ignore the violence against men in each of these areas � no matter who the perpetrator.'

33,Life has returned pretty much back to normal after my Easter Cyber-Fest Thank goodness I was in very serious danger of turning into a geek.
33,I took the hire car for a spin this afternoon - to meet a man.
33,It's almost 8pm and I've just finished preparing my completions for tomorrow.
33,I've done very well this week - only 1 really late night at work I haven't exactly been shirking my duties at least I've been trying to devote some long-overdue time to some of my charitable activities - oh and having a facial Wow Did I need it I was buffed and rubbed by Anna - delightful wee thing with mad Bjorkish bunches - I decided against the hi-tech lifting doobrey My looks may be fading but I'm not ready for that yet I opted for the deep cleanse instead.
33,I decided at 3.30pm today that I would resign from my Charity position - I had not even started to look at Friday's post let alone today's and my in-tray was higher than my washing pile at home Something had to give and my charitable indulgences seemed the obvious choice I rang the new Chair-in-Waiting and told her I would be taking a few months sabbatical - I meant it I came off the phone all proud of myself at having finally said 'no' - not an expression I've used often as a 30-something single mum I went to rescue my carat 6.30pm from the multi-storey with every intention of going back to the office but the further away I got from it the more I decided the work would still be there tomorrow - so I started to drive home and before I knew it I was in the car park of the Baptist Church - venue for the AGM Well I had invited the speaker would be rude not to show my face I'm pleased I did - the proceedings started perfunctorily - I found myself agreeing to remain as Publicity Officer (joke - I write the odd editorial for the paper and run a Ball or 2) I could have kicked myself after all my brave words on the phone about being too busy but then I never could say no But my speaker What a delight A localish-ish Funeral Director Not your normal choice of bon vivant but an absolute pearl Funny compelling witty discreet compassionateand extremely respectful to the objects of his dialogue (and dialogue it was with audience participation encouraged) He has a book out in a couple of weeks - ' YoursEventually' 120 stories randomly collected over 30 years as a funeral director - if his delivery of half a dozen of those anecdotes tonight are anything to go by he will have you in raptures and tears for the small price of £6.99 Mark Tyack He'll be big - you saw it here first
33,Well that was a pleasnt weekend.
33,I wasn't exactly skiving off early tonight - I mean ok so I went to the hairdressers at 5 o'clock but he is a client so it was just like I was still working reeaaallyy Albeit whilst having my roots done and a few blonde highlights dotted here and there (and he did it for free on account of that fact that I was still working) He's lovely my hairdresser - Danny - handsome funny and unstereotypically straight - what's more he's newly single and gets changed into his football strip to blow-dry my hair And I don't even have to pay him to do it he's just getting ready to go straight to his 6-a-side game as soon as he's finished de-HattieJacquesing me - when one of his mates or his equally dishy (and also remarkably unhomosexual) brother are there too passing the masking papers or holding the ceramic straighteners I can think of nowhere better than to relax from the rigours of a stressful week.
33,I'm really pleased I did as I was told for once and stayed away from the office all weekend.
33,Blissful day Slept 'til about 11 having spent far too long talking to a would-be accountant from the North West and a very unusual Irish giant - it was mad - my son would have been shocked - I certainly was Anyway I lay in bed for the entire Jonathan Ross programme reading - not my new novel but a foodie magazine got all inspired and headed for my temple St Tesco as soon as I'd deloused myself in the bathroom.
33,I did it I pulled the rabbit out of the hat - again God I'm proud of myself sometimes.
33,Horrible day Yuk Yuk Started badly - didn't get out of the wrong side of bed just got out too late Thank goodness my secretary is trained to give me a wake up call when I don't appear within half an hour of my ETA I finally did battle with the dreaded Sasser worm last night and had a bit of a cyber fest into the bargain - well it was his birthday and he is very cute Anyway the birds were up before I was even tucked up - must remember not to do that on a school night again But it was fun.
33,I finally did it Got off the sofa threw on some clothes (not my first choice but they were in the wash) and went to meet a man A proper real living breathing man I was really nervous - much more so than before an exam - I sail through those and the examiner never cares how huge your arse is I spent ages faffing about and running backwards and forwards to the loo - CM was getting really frustrated 'cos he wanted dropping off at his mates and I couldn't tell him where I was going After I'd looked in the mirror for the 20th time he finally screamed 'For Goodness sake you look beautiful and you're only going to the flipping office' We'd arranged to meet at a tourist attraction close to my office.
33,You would think given that I only live next door my mother would have been able to give me a little advance notice that my new patio door was being fitted today - it's not a lot to ask surely.
33,I was reeeeaaaallllly dancing last night.
33,It's my First Knickers Day The anticipation has been immense - what would they be like who would they be from was I wrong in ruling out dental-floss-esque styles(anyone that knows me will be siding with my better instinct on that) So - white lacy hipster midi French styley Very nice actually - and as I haven't done any washing this week - arrived just in the Knick() of time from Julie in Gloucestershire - I have a sneaking suspicion she might be a friend of my cousin Jennie - the lazy buggers in Hull haven't done it yet Gosh I bet you are wondering what on earth I'm going on about I know discussing my underwear is a bit extreme even for me.
33,I've missed my secretary -she's been poorly sick for 3 days now - I've just had Ling to do my bidding - and she did great for the first 2 days - but today I gave her my completions to do - only 10 today and all purchases (bar one which was a very straightforward sale) - they were all t'd up and couldn't have been an easier day to start - she did well - but she thought she did outstandingly well - she was smugger than ever this afternoon and kept bustling into my office every 5 flipping minutes - I shut my door for a reason being 'I'm busy - I vant to be alone' - Jacquie knows that instinctively - Ling obviously sees it as a challenge - or an invitation to irritate me as much as possible - she was outstanding at that So tonight I was home just after 8pm - had a good long chat with Eva - God she gave me some great material for my book - then Jack came home and went online - I fell asleep - only just woken up (3.45am) - and I've missed the Throb - means I've got to wait til Sunday at the earliest now - and I'll need an early pre-school night then Bugger But I did have some fun with that cute solicitor before I left work - dinner is now just a few emails away - I can feel it Oh and I went shopping in an extended lunch hour - get me having a break on a Friday I could get used to Ling after all - tried on loads of tops in the sales - and the only ones that fitted were 14s and then some were a bit baggy Didn't find the perfect corset-style top I was after but got a very acceptable scoop neck chiffon number which will look great with my new leather skirt tomorrow night.
33,My uber-efforts at work are paying off - down to my last large pile of files to work on - but it has more to do with the fact that the strain has finally taken it's toll on my secretary who is currently nursing a nasty rash enlarged glands and a puffy face - I've told her to stay at home as long as it takes - I already have a propensity to all those traits and don't need any added assistance from my assistant.
33,I picked one of the best ever matches to miss by all accounts.
33,I must be the only person not watching the England-Croatia match judging by the groans and cheers I can hear from the pubs outside the office - and they are all quite a way off so I dread to think what is happening out there.
33,Why do the weekends go so quickly and why do I never seem to achieve any of the things I plan to do I just about manage to do the washing give the place a very very quick once over and then it's Sunday night again and I have to think about getting up early.
33,I should have the mother of all hangovers today as I was still chatting on the phone 'til a ridiculous hour.
33,Martin rescued me from another late Friday in the office with a very well-timed call inviting me to the pub I was happy to accept - I've not seen much of Martin since I started my fab new job and he makes me feel a little guilty about it - but then I did introduce him to Sophie and I hope they both remember that in a few years time when they are choosing Godparents for their first born.
33,La la la La la la La la la la la la la la England Wow What a performance I watched it via my Yahoo Sport online commentary and then listened to it in the car on the way home.
33,My pleas have finally been heard by our super-efficient Office Manager - I now have a large oscillating fan keeping me cool.
33,It looks like I'm going to have to go over to Leeds mid-week if I have any hope of seeing The Ring this side of autumn.
33,I am The Last Single Person in Cheryl's World.
33,Debbie Harry is a Goddess Ok - so she was backlit and had fans blowing her platinum retro hair but there is no denying that she has It and she can sing and move one of the sexiest things I've witnessed - last year's Rugby World Cup aside.
33,I've made it to the end of the week and I still have some energy left.
33,I was up and at'em this morning and would have been an hour early for work(think it might have had something to do with the endorphins released by chatting to Mr. Sunday Mr Thursday-Night Mr Next-Monday and Mr Weekend-Later-in-the-Month simultaneously last night - good job I'd stayed on the bottled water wouldn't have wanted to get those messages mixed up) but I decided to use the extra time to make an 8-mile half hour detour to the car hire place to pick up the gym bag and other stuff that I'd left in the Astra boot.
33,It has been glorious sunshine outside today apparently.
33,Ladies There are handsome sexy well-mannered young men on this thing I know I just met one.
33,It's 5.30 am - just woken up on the sofa where I fell asleep about midnight - probably earlier as the telly was crap - I was determined not to be up all night chatting inanely to strangers so I've had a result - drinking water now and thinking about bed.
33,I thought yesterday was bad It was But not a patch on today.
33,I don't know why I bothered getting up today.
33,Everyone should have a Japanese exchange student - but only if they also have a Mum like mine.
33,This week is going to be a doddle The Japanese boy arrived and was picked up by my mum.
33,He's gone Ca c'est formidable It was well worth getting up at 4am and standing around the council car park.
33,I am despairing of my French ward.
33,Rush Rush Rush That's all I seem to do at the moment - even my nose is streaming at a rate of knots.
33,I'be dot a dold I thought I was just in a crabby mood when I woke up yesterday but the sneezing started by about 10am and it was rapidly downhill mainly down my nose in fact and by last night I was shivering coughing and could barely breathe - I just about managed to stay up to watch Grif and his ruins and then turned in for the night - wish I'd realized that the non-drowsy Sudafed meant stimulant I endured one of those nights where you toss and turn and seem to look at the clock every hour and only 5 minutes has passed - I then fell asleep at about 6 just before the alarm went off.
33,The French boy's Unibrow has more personality than he himself has I have rarely come across someone so uncommunicative.
33,This could be a very long 2 weeks.
33,Victor est arrivee (if anyone knows how to type accents please let me know - I can do it in Word but not sure on this site).
33,I very nearly drove to Lisa'a last night for Vickie's hen night.
33,I am doing cartwheels Metaphorically - not literally - though for the first time since I was about 12 I am actually tempted I HAVE AN ASSISTANT AND SHE'S EXPERIENCED GOOD FAST AND QUIETER THAN ME Quite simply she's perfect.
33,I wasn't sure whether Ian was joking when he promised to wear his thong to bring breakfast this morning.
33,I've got another quasi-celebrity claim to fame - but I can't really tell you about it - and it isn't really that great But do you remember Survivor - that reality show where they put a load of dreadful people in an even worse place to see who started to eat each other first Well it turns out a chap I've been emailing on a particular matter was part of the show Gosh I might have been even nicer to him if I'd known - you know how Starstruck I get Anyway that brightened up an otherwise boring afternoon - I've had a pretty uneventful sort of day really trough after the peak maybe - not that it was low in any way nor that the last few days have been high Mind you I did like getting texts late from that cute solicitor - and I blush now when I remember suggesting we bunk off work for the afternoon and go to the park - I didn't think for a minute he would bite - and he didn't - good job too as I had appointments booked this afternoon - now I just pray something proper happens on this case so I have a serious rather than tenuous reason to make contact.
33,I was in bliss for an hour and a half tonight I cannot remember the last time I felt so relaxed.
33,It's the weekend - official Nadia has won - I wept - fuck knows why - but I did I thought my days of weeping at Andrex adverts was over but I guess I'm still soft.
33,What is going on here I made a fab posting last night but it doesn't appear to have saved at all.
33,The week has started off well - my gnat bites are fading and don't make me look quite so much like a domestic violence victim my bank balance has been refuelled and all my friends are happy well and either expecting babies recently married or about to be even Marko has had a few days off work and has more lined up soon.

33,It's been one of those nights you 'survive' and I want nothing more than to rest my head on my soft magenta pillow scented of lavender and vanilla close my eyes and drift into sleep.
33,Well I have an odd sort of tradition in my house I thought I'd share.
33,This empty page is mocking me My pens run out of ink The words are dancing ‘round my head So loud that I can’t think I sit and try to catch my rhyme The cat’s just chased it back So don’t blame me for the lack of prose I’m under some attack These feeling felt deep down inside Want to see the light of day But the day is running into night So in darkness they shall stay
33,Raised up on broken promises Fed on shards of shattered dreams We strive to always please you With our muffled little screams We’re fallen angels Hearts torn & mangled Twisted and tangled In half-truths &amp; lullabies Deaf ears & cold blind eyes Spawn our fall from grace With each silent knowing face Another angel slips away Conceived in your conjectures Cultivated by the fears Nourished in the nothingness We embrace for many years We’re the fallen angels Hearts torn out &amp; mangled Twisted and tangled In half-truths & lullabies These monsters in disguise Maim without a trace Dissolve us in our place Another angel slips away Sunken in your footsteps Entangled in the past Some wounds will never heal These scars we’re made to last We’re fallen angels Hearts torn &amp; mangled Twisted and tangled In half-truths &amp; lullabies Even ourselves we now despise Doubt dwells within the space Carved out in our disgrace And another angel slipped away Jasmine 2001

47,Dear God: I choose Lord to believe you allow pets in Heaven.
47,I just want this to all end Whether through death or another way I really don’t care I just want peace.
47,What will you see when you first met me Will you see the inner me that is hurting &amp; bleeding Or will you see outer me and pass judgement on what you see Will you see the scars on my body and have compassion Or will you see the scars and dismiss me as a crazy woman Will you look in my eyes an see my pain reflected their Or will you think you are better than me and not even look in my eyes Will you take time to learn my name Or will you just pass me up as another endless face you see Will you listen with your heart to my words Or hear with your ears only the ears you want to hear Will you see my soul broken and destroyed Or will you see just another way to get person that is meaningless to you Will you connect with me with intentions to help Or will you just push on past me without a second glance VLH 7/28/04
47,I am different than anyone else here on this earth especially in my mind.
47,Faith What is faith I have heard it described in many ways - different meanings to the same word.

47,I am working on learning how to handle my fear.
47,I am in God’s loving hands I will never walk alone He is a part of me In everything I do.
47,When I think of you God A smile blossoms in my heart Joy bursts out in my soul And love radiates from my being.
47,One night I was lonely and lost.
47,I was asked the other day what would my idea of heaven would be like.
47,I guess I’ll give up On all this friendship jazz Cause I don’t know the rules And I seem to keep breaking them.
47,A friend is one who walks in and stays by my side when all others run away from me.
47,I am being haunted By my mind The thoughts just seem out of reach And I cannot reach them at all.
47,For the first time in my life sleep has now become my enemy.
47,I am so use to listening To my own mind my own voices my own counsel.
47,How will I know when I am doing God’s will If I were to know His will for me wouldn’t it just be as easy as breathing to follow it I know God wants to lead me – even more than I want to be lead.
47,July 8 2004 My dearest God: Nineteen months ago Lord I didn’t even know you.
47,It is really possible Could I really actually experience Could I really actually enjoy A best day in my life A day I could celebrate This person that is I And all my accomplishments And hardships too.
47,When I see dirty dishes in my sink I thank God for the food that made the dishes dirty.
47,7/08/04 Dear God I guess I need to start this intimacy journey I want to take with you.
47,What will I see When I look into your eyes Will I see love and understanding Or will I see hate and anger Will I see grace and compassion Or will I see judgement and dislike Will I see sympathy and mercy Or will I see meanness and pain Will I see acceptance and caring Or will I see trouble and a oppressor Will I see humility towards me Or will I see someone that wants to terrorize me Will I see that I am worthy Or will I see that I am not Will I see you reaching out a helping hand Or will I see you strike out to destroy When I look in your eyes What will I see Will I see God reflected back to me Or will I see satan looking distastefully at me Vlh 7/7/04
47,In the beginning God thought of me And He formed me With His own two hands.
47,Sometimes my life gets really good And everything just falls into place When everything is perfect and good Just the way I want my life to be.
47,There is no way my life can be only one lifetime.
47,Anticipation- the act of looking forward; especially : pleasurable expectation visualization of a future event or state As children we anticipate almost everything.
47,This is really cool and no doubt God planned it this way.
47,I am slowly learning that contentment will never be found apart from God.
47,At times the thoughts in my head seem to hide out loud.
47,God has no need for a garbage can.
47,Appreciation - an _expression of admiration approval or gratitude Since I have come to know God I am learning how to appreciate.
47,My world was dark with no light inside.
47,I am sure almost everyone has heard of a social worker.
47,Many times in my life I have been dropped crumpled and ground into the dirt by the decisions I’ve made.
47,Lately I have felt like I have streaming silent tears softly gently falling down my face that only I know about.
47,Lately I have noticed my mood has slipped down a bit and I am doing odd things.
47,We must be hurt in order to grow; We must fail in order to know We must lose in order to gain.
47,Dear Child: Effective immediately please be aware that there are changes you need to make in your life.
47,I just had to write to tell you how much I love you and care for you.
47,Seen in the paper the other day 'Childhood molestation scars victims for life' And I thought that this was the understatement of the century.
47,I know in my heart and my soul and my mind that God is my strong tower.
47,At first I saw God as my observer my judge keeping track of the things I did wrong so as to know whether I merited heaven or hell when I die.
47,One night I was alone and heartbroken in pain and torment.
47,I have this rope the rope of my life With lots of chains of different lengths Some are little bity ones Really tiny in fact.
47,My life has changed so much Since I let God into my life Sometimes I can’t seem to even Recognize myself.

34,Quick report the kids are doing what I would term a very good (bordering on great) job with this musical.
34,Quick update: I snuck in 10 minutes each on tuba trombone and trumpet this afternoon.
34,Another good question: How often would Der Chor perform per month The more churches we represent (i.e.
34,Reminder: Jan Wall from Spencerville Academy has asked us to play with her band for church at Triadelphia on May 15.
34,Here's what I'm aware of at the moment in case anyone wants to co-ordinate with us this weekend.
34,Hey Daniel thank you so much for including the warms ups.
34,Corey your pledge has been heard (received read) and witnessed.
34,David it sounds like a good beginning.
34,Progress on practice is slow but steady: two 5-minute sessions Wednesday evening and a 10-minute session Thursday morning.
34,How chic to be referred to as 'spice'
34,What sort of music would Der Chor sing Would it be standard fair or high church What sort of denominations of churches if any are in mind What would the frequency of guest spots be for Der Chor What would a typical service look like that included Der Chor Would there be a collection of appropriate responses Would this be purely vocal or a musical combo Just thought I would throw these out for a start.
34,I just scanned the rest of the blogs and i will try to read them more thourougly tomorrow.
34,Der Chor is a choir concept.
34,I don't know yet but I know that it calls for at least two flutes.
34,I concur with David’s kudos to Danny for setting up this forum.
34,I enjoy Daniel's philosophy of getting things done.
34,I'm still trying to figure that out myself.
34,I'm starting this web-log after discussions at our Triadelphia Low Brass rehearsal this evening.
34,Ashton Family: Sabbath afternoon is taken starting around 3:30 as Danny has to head to HVA to play in a brass quintet there which should wrap up around 6:30.

34,Hey looks like i will not be here on the 15th... but the 29th looks good.
34,Jan Wall asks: The Academy band is trying to put together a couple of pieces for Senior Graduation Sabbath at Spencerville.
34,I have already noticed improvement in my husband's trombone performance.
34,First i must admit I was a bit reluctant to 'give up' the 'cello as i was enjoying doing what i could but i could see that Daniel was not really itching to go back to the audience... and i did have another instrument...
34,Jamey gave me one of the best gifts I've received from anyone ever this weekend quite by accident.
34,In the absence of David Greene I do not expect to be meeting with Geri this Tuesday.
34,If you're out of town take your mouthpiece.
34,5-10 minutes per day every day.
34,The king and I is finished I had an enjoyable time yesterday.
34,I guess it depends upon how the individual that used the word defines/views it I am guessing that based upon your post that the implication was that this is a bad habit.
34,In recent conversation someone (not one of our team) referred to my musical interests as a habit to be supported i.e.
34,for some strange reason i am feeling the need to play a small Tuba :o) BTW planning to bring my bass to church for dulcimer play... as well as the horn and cello (celli) for afternoon play.

34,:o) Great to hear that Corey had a mini practice with a visitor how cool If you want i can try to help you solder up any holes and try to make the scrap metal less scrappy I have a small solder iron here and a large solder machine in Hagerstown.

34,This sounds great Two more low strings.
34,Remarkably I am back from my eventful and otherwise LONG trip.
34,Speaking of fish when are we going to practice the Trout again I have two friends who would like to double up on the bass and the cello parts and play to have fun.
34,Hello just a quick practice report.
34,Yes but with big help from Vicki and Danny Thanks They look over my shoulder therefore next time more.
34,Great plan it reminds me of a house that was being built next to a house i was helping to build... there was a dance floor being installed in the basement now home theaters are the norm but this idea is quite akin to that idea.
34,This is an idea I've been mulling over for some time and it came back to me this morning.
34,Arrive at 7:00 begin practicing at 7:15.
34,Monday May 10 8 PM The Lyceum - Old Town Alexandria Valor Brass - Mike Mergen Chris Smith - trpts.

13,ok so i've been over at ellies since sat.
13,I hope you will pick us up this friday.
13,i guess things are back to what they used to be right me talkin to you or what i think you are and you stay confined to your self a million miles away.
13,On Saturday we went through all the stuff in grandma’s and grandpa’s basement.
13,I have been so busy.Its like theres no stop.I have been to Port Alberni recently and I saw my cousin Rebecca.We talked to Kyle and Charles(Charles for only 5 minutes)It was pretty cool.Rebecca turned on webcam it was on me aLOTI went to Victoria yesterday.Gone to the waterslides but they sucked.I had to push myself all the way down.The best part about that was the tube rides.wheee.Also went to the Royal B.c Museum and visited the Enternal Egypt exhibit.Boy oh Boy it was pretty intresting.The dead 10 year old boy mummy was pretty gross.Its like I could have nightmares.hehe.I got a new kitty named Banaya.i havent really gotten into the whole new cat thing.I still think its pretty soon to get a new cat after our other one ran away well escaped.McDonalds Quarter Pounders are truly gross.You can taste the grease.It was pretty sickening.I made myself a song last night titled Try by Rachel Volkman.Its pretty cool.I gonna go fly.later
13,I have to go home soon.Its going to be crazy.My brother and his friend is over and when he is over they go bonkers.They don't even leave me alone.I might go for a bike ride later.Away from everything and everyone.I really need to.I hate how parents just think they understand us when they don't.Their strict and they just wnat to keep you forever.I am so confused right now.The guy that I like is really pissing me off.Some times he'll talk to me then sometimes he just avoids me.I shouldn't even be liking him.You see I am thirteen and hes like how oldAnyways Im stupid for likeing guys who are older than me and never see me as anything except maybe a younger friend.I don't evn now if I like him.I think but then again I just don't know.I am confused .This whole guy/girl thing is crazy.I mean at this age you have to be a slut or a bitch and to show your boobsbelly and booty just to be liked.If you don't have big boobs chances are they won't like you until highschool.RELATIONSHIPS ARE CONFUSING
13,Am I really that simple minded like I was told.I don't think so.So I was laughing about Mr.Duffy is Fluffy and very puffy.I only act that way around Caitlin not around everyone else.I rode my bike to the library to go on the computer because My computer at home is so old that it is a dinosaur.I checked my emails which was pretty much unnecessary and I wanted to work on my website which is quite fun.I got books but i don't know when I will get the chance.Went downtown earlier and bought a whole bunch of stuff that I didn't need.My mom wants me to throw out a bunch of things but I can't all have memories or I might need them.I get to watch a movie tonight Secret Window.I already seen it.But hey its a good movie.Next year I am joining Air cadets.It might be scary.I don't Know any one in there like The time at the 70's Dance Meagan helped me not be scared but that was totally diffrent.I am not know anyone in there.I want to finish my Guiding years and quit papers.Everyday when I have to do it I get pissed off because the papers fly off or they get wet and then they don't even care that you take time out of your day to deliver papers.Then I might have to quit the youth events committee but if I do.I want to thank all of them for what they have done.Crystal and Meagan will be leaving because Meagan's going to finland and I think crystal is going to college.I can't believe Natasha joined when she did.Everyone was like Oh god
13,Glad to be in Parksville.Away from tourists and traffic jams.No more torture car rides with the un-wanted.On the trip I learned to be more patient and good things happen to those who wait.Today on the bright side I made myself a website and got to be with friends.Ate chocolate bars and drank pop.
39,Some of the news isn't appalling.
39,I'm trying to keep a record of all the news items each day that I run across that I find absolutely appalling.
39,They're all forks today because I have a sinus headache and that's what it feels like.
39,It's actually easy to be appalled on both sides of the playing field.
39,Maybe I'm just blindly provincial but the following news item shocked the crap out of me today.
39,Ok maybe I'm just a sick fuck but every time I see that Stacker 2 ad - you know the one where the guy couldn't get into the Navy until he lost 60 pounds - I think it would make a great SNL anti-war ad.
39,I'm trying to keep things relatively safe over on the daily guilt site (in case someone serious decides that I'm publishable and doesn't want to know that I talk about non-PG-13 things) even though I've already used the word 'fuck' throughout it.
39,Today I woke up to junk mail from the W himself.
39,I don't know how it happened but I ended up on a republican email distribution list a few years ago.
39,For an apatheist cynic critical thinker realist etc.
39,An excerpt from a note I'd sent someone explaining how I got to Houston from NJ... ' I'd been in Seattle - lovely lovely Seattle - when I made the mistake of getting married to and pregnant by a guy who was going to get his PhD faster than I was.
39,I finally found a reality show I could really sink my teeth into.
39,Went out training last night for the first time in a while.
39,I got carded the other day.
39,It turns out that the other week was the week the calves were taken away from the cows and the relentless mooing that kept me awake was just part of 'how they get' at that time of the year... Hormones.
39,Ok so what's the deal with the Dick York/Dick Sargeant thing I mean say you're nine or ten and you come home after school to watch the season premiere of Bewitched and you find Samantha sleeping with another man AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT'S NOT THE SAME GUY It's like the Sixth Sense or something I'm going to take a moment to wallow in my victimhood and decide to blame my whole misguided adulthood on the fact that my moral compass hit a magnetic anomaly when I watched a near family member trade her husband in for a better looking one.
39,I am shockingly not creative when I have PMS.
39,My cousin Stuart and I have an ongoing discussion about God and his existence.
39,'Moo' is a totally inadequate transliteration of cow talk.
13,Okay my last post wasn't that fabulous but now i'm talking about my diet.
13,Okay i'm sad that the love of my life bought his girlfriend over today...but happy that the like of my existance likes me back.

45,If you find me you can have a better present than a dig-it-yourself dinosaur bones thingy.
45,And not just because the weekend is so very close.
45,On Monday I got home from work at 6.45 and was almost bowled over by my daughter demanding I produce a brown long sleeved t-shirt and brown trousers for her to take to school the next day.
45,I can't believe how much better I feel.
45,I've been meaning to do this for a while but like everything in my life the reality of my 'To Do ASAP' pile is that it's 'May Do in 5 Years' but now I'm fit to burst and here is my first blog.
45,No not the crappy Nelly/Kelly song.
45,Now I am a very liberal minded person but when my boss sent me this link I was quite perturbed.

45,To Paul for winning in our local pub quiz thanks to my gout.
45,Woo hoo another 3 days off work.
45,I am on a diet and I have just realised the benefit of being on a diet this lunchtime.
45,If it isn't one it's the other.
45,Why will my 9 year old daughter not go to bed I'm knackered and I really think she should be in bed before me or is that an old fashioned idea There are only us 2 here tonight and I just want her to go to bed AND BLOODY STAY THERE
45,I had 3 days off work to spend some time with my kids in the school hols.
45,I seriously lost the will to live by page 83 (Section 6 Transaction Processing) and so I pretended I'd finished the dullest of dull Member Banks Interface Manual.
45,This weekend has been one of those lovely indulgent summer weekends.
34,I wonder about what makes a person decide to drive drunk through a cop-infested county all in the name of smoking a joint.
34,....I'm not going to try and remember every little thing that happened the past nine years after I began rigging but rather just go on from here with all the follies that occur.

34,Yesterday someone on ljknitting posted that the barnes and noble in her area had the suss knit kits on sale.

34,Today Alicen and I went to the knitting bee.
34,this is the slipper that i really thought I would love.

34,This is the birthday dress I made for Alicen when she turned one year old.
34,I am going to start backwards because I don't know if I can find photos of all my knit stuff.
34,I had been toying with the idea of creating a journal/blog for just my knitting things as it has become quite the obsession.
13,I reached home today at about 4.45pm just before my mum and my brother came home I can't help but lie to my mum that I came home at 4.15.. Before I went home I went to Westmall with one of my friend to eat lunch and borrow books from the library.
45,What Pete wrote about drivers in the Dallas area is absolutely true.

45,Just for those who don't understand my love of reptiles snakes in particular I am writing this is response to a note that was posted by a friend.
45,It saddens me to say that my son's snake died.
45,I didn't mention it before but I had a similar experience in regard to Jc getting a jury summons in the mail.
45,Before I go any further I have to say up front that I do not believe in telepathy prescience or any other of the pseudo-scientific junk that flies around these days.
45,Rooting through my mail I found this nifty catalog of really expensive junk that I thought would be fun to look through even though I'd probably never but any of it.
45,Well it was bound to happen sooner or later.
45,These days there's no way that there is anyone left on the planet who hasn't heard of the Atkins&trade;&reg; Diet.

47,WOW what an awesome meeting last night...I commend all of you for your input and your willingness to open up to all.
47,More and more research is showing that people who have the personal guidance of a mentor or coach have a far greater chance of succeeding on their weight loss program than those people who try and go it alone.

46,I just got in from driving Amanda home and I'll tell ya I saw more deer tonight than I've seen in two Winters combined.
46,Besides all the other crazy bullshit that went on around here last night a friend of my son's was killed in a car accident.
46,This Enetation commenting system is starting to piss me off majorly.
46,New Years Eve 2002 Bye bye 2002.................it's been fun.
46,My apologies to anyone that had left comments that have since disapeared.
46,Well I finally got this new skin up but I still have a few kinks to work out.
46,The word comments has mysteriously changed to poseurs.
46,Merry Merry Christmas to one and all Man am I happy to be home.
46,Today was a productive day to say the least.
46,I haven't been bloggong in awhile as I've either been working or frantically trying to get ready for Christmas.
46,Well yesterday I had my annual 'holiday meltdown'.
46,I was trying to do a new lay-out but I screwed that up big time so fo now I just fixed the shit I messed up yesterday.
46,You think I'd learn not to piss with my page.
46,I really should be in bed by now but I feel like I'm still unwinding from the horrid day I had today.
46,I had a fabulously wonderful day today............doing something I wanted to do instead of doing things I should do.
46,Note to self: When going To Wal Mart do not pop into Fashion Bug to ' browse '.
46,'Trees that don't produce nuts' was the search entry that brought someone to check out my site.
46,Well I was in the mood to change the look of my page a bit but I really like the lay-out.
46,I really like the Swappingtons way of doing things.
46,I slept until 11:30 today and I have to say it felt wonderful.
46,Has it been almost a week since I last graced my Blog pages with useless rambling bullshit Sheesh I guess so How time flys when your tired as a dead dog and gagging on gross cough meds just so you can try to eek out perhaps a couple hours of sleep at night.
46,After choking back my morning dose of cough syrup the thought occurred to me.
46,The meeting with the District Jackass oops I mean Manager was cancelled due to snow.
46,It was pure suckage at work today.
46,I'm bummed my Steelers lost today but it was one hell of good game I'll tell ya.
46,I haven't felt like posting lately as just as I was bragging to Hubbs that I haven't been sick in 2 years wham I get hit with a nasty cold.
46,Sometimes I wonder why so many people spend so much time thinking about life instead of living it.
46,As planned I did take the day off and so far it's been going well in the cleaning department.
46,Steelers pull off win over the 'Brownies' (There's a couple of pissed off Browns fans out there that aren't gonna be happy wearing my Steeler gear over the next week )
46,Well Nick just came home a bit ago and I can't wait to hear all the details about the wedding.
46,Update on the 'Compassion Training': Today Jeffrey was bitching and moaning to me and I didn't say 'Shut the f up' once Progress is being made
46,I took the day off today..........and guess what I'm gonna do Relax relax relax and you guess it......................relax Sounds like the perfect way to spend ones birthday.
46,Happy Birthday to me YaHooo........I made it to 45
46,Today was another stressful day at work.
46,I was sitting here trying to figure out what my one New Years resolution was going to be this year.
46,I just caught sight of my new exercise mat waiting unopened under the tree.
46,Well another New Years Eve has come and gone and as usual I bought too much cheese.
46,If my last post seemed to rhyme in any way........it was........not planned.
46,I owe I owe so off to work I go Have a great Friday everyone
46,My last post is directed to those of you that experience winter every year.
46,I don't know about you but I sure as hell am glad that February is about to end.
46,When it comes to reading web logs there's nothing that bugs me more than people that just can't friggin' spell or don't bother to check their spelling.
46,Today was a nice day spent at home.
46,I'm going to get rid of this Pepto Dismal pink pretty soon.
46,The thought of all those young people lost in that tragic club fire in Rhode Island just has me so upset and sad.
46,There is power in prayer this I know.
46,Today's prayer: 'Dear Lord since I have discovered Ebay my life has gone to auction hell.
46,I didn't smack Joy upside her head yesterday but I did tell her that if she ever does that shit again I'm gonna haul her outside and give her a good ass whippin'.
46,Thanks Amanda for loaning me the Tae Bo tape You're a sweetie
46,Work was less than great today.
46,Hubby and I had a fantastic Valentines Day.
46,I sure am one lucly lady.
46,I hope the colors don't hurt the eyes too much.......I was in a Valentine's Day kinda mood.
46,Well I offically started my Tae Bo workouts today and I guess it's obvious it didn't kill me (yet).
46,I really got alot done today which was a nice surprise considering that I had originally planned on sitting on my ass all day and doing nuthin' I went to Wal Mart and had my oil changed in the New Yorker and did a bit of cosmetic shopping.
46,I'm really excited about starting Tae bo workouts.
46,Well I haven't posted in awhile because I've been pretty busy working and really haven't had much to say.
46,Hubbs arrived home safely tonight around 8ish.

46,Here's another interesting search entry that brought someone to my site........'Do trees sleep at a regular time' And I thought I was quirky Yikes.
46,Once again a search of 'Do trees sleep' brought someone to my site.
46,Nick and Amanda arrived safley home around 6:30am Saturday.

46,I am so happy I get to tool around in the Vette a few more days than I had planned due to upcoming nice weather over the next 5 days Yes I am a happy chick indeed It's always a sad day when I have to put her in winter storage.
46,Well three more lovely days left untill my feet once again cross the threshold into retail insanity.
46,I decided at the last minute to stop at the Mall yesterday on my way home from my cardio workout.

46,I just found out tonight that my brother is having a small get-together at his house for my nephew Mikeys birthday.

13,im goin to start a protest against adults .
13,tonite i offically found out that my sister is in fact a wonder .
34,Allow me to start with the design of our house.
34,Wow This is a real cool way to document how I built our present house (And I am still working on it...).
34,When we finally came here the roof has been installed.
34,This is now the living room the side that faces the back part of our house sometime in aug 2003.
34,Gary is installing the cooking range here...behind him is the area where we would have the sink and countertop.
34,This is the wash-bathroom downstairs first to be encountered when one enters the house from the garage.
34,Boys on their bed ready to go to sleep ().
34,Yesterday we prepared their rooms for painting.
34,These are the beds that Gary made for the boys.
34,This shows the first layer of mud that I have applied on the corners.
34,I have long applied mud on the sheetrock joints save for the corners .
34,My husband and I are currently woroking on the second floor specifically the boys' rooms.
34,This was the 'dead space' beside Ben's room that Gary decided to convert into his office.
34,The CMP already did its job.
34,Last Saturday Gary managed to fix the fountain at the flower garden (despite the missing hose).
34,The past weekend Gary started working on the sidings of the house (something which is best done while it is still summer - warm and dry outside).
34,This is now what Gary has made of his office adjacent to Ben's.
34,Seedlings I prepared with Mom's help consisting of pansies foxgloves shasta daisies plus tomatillos and jalapeño peppers.
34,Bluins () according to my husband's friend (upon his description) These are clusters of tiny wild flowers that tend to spread.
34,The same flower below with a different inner color of its petals...
34,This spring there have been a lot of flowerplants at Mom's that have started to bloom.
34,I got these flowers from the plants shown on the ground below almost as high as the feet.
34,This is now how my flower garden looks like.
34,Here is another cluster of plants being invaded by sprouts of another flower plant.
34,Here I have pulled out the weeds at the cluster of the tulips and put mulch (Mom said that this would choke the weeds that would attempt to grow from under).
34,I gathered some grass clippings (my husband mowed the lawn the previous day) then started putting mulch on the flowerplants.
34,At this time the weeds are now quite distinguishable.
34,Today we worked on the vegetable garden.
34,This is Mom's greenhouse containing all the seedlings of her flowerplants.
34,This is Ana's garden which her mom started for her.
34,This lilac bush is partly hidden by a tree situated near the beginning of our driveway at the periphery of our lawn.
34,Almost resembling grass this unknown-to-me plant has tiny white flowers.
34,Gary has fixed the fountain despite a missing hose.
34,When Ana's mom came to meet me we discovered something in common: the liking for plants and gardening.
34,Columbine (Aquilegia caerulea) taken at dusk...Notice the gentle curving of its spikes.
34,Some of the flowers around the house...
34,Pansy common name for any of a family of plants having large showy flowers composed of five leafy sepals five to ten petals numerous stamens and two to five carpels each with numerous round black shiny seeds.
34,I captured the following photos of two birds fighting over something (a mate perhaps).
34,These are 3 plants that were growing outside of my flower garden (i.e.
34,Baby racoons scavenging for food...they were attacking our garbage cans.
34,Found this small nest (the hollow middle just about the size of a regular egg) on the lawn.
34,Tomatillas (husk tomatoes) are used for salsa according to Mom.
34,The lilies along the driveway near the vegetable garden also have started to bloom.
34,As the name implies these are like miniature sunflowers.
34,Feathery soft layer of petals upon another layer underneath.
34,More daylilies (of a different color than the first I posted)...these are those next to my veggie garden.
34,Can anyone help me identify these flowers Hummingbirds like them.
34,A frog and a toad now reside in our fountain.
34,These are irises that I transplanted.
34,Peanut butter is an American tradition.
34,As I thought of how I should proceed with my mini-project I was thinking that posting recipes would be slow...about at least 1 per week perhaps... Then I thought that since my purpose of maintaining this blog is to cover other topics that has to do with nutrition and health aside from cooking and baking maybe I should post a different topic at least on a per day basis like.... Monday - Kitchen tips Tuesday - Health and Nutrition Tips Wednesday - Miscellaneous topics Thursday - a recipe for cooking Friday - a recipe for baking Saturday and Sunday will be my days off my blog because I will dedicate those days to my family.
34,Today is the birth of my foodblog featuring my collection of Filipino recipes as well as American recipes with kitchen tips and health and nutrition tips.
34,This is from My Yahoo: 1) Keep your kitchen full of vegetables that won't spoil quickly -- onions garlic potatoes winter squash carrots.
34,This is from food journalist Mark Bittman.
34,I have never met any Filipino or non-Filipino who did not like the taste of this easy to prepare savory dish.
34,This is from Yahoo News: People who are obese are at increased risk of heart disease
34,I am too busy right now (we're finishing the boys' rooms) to write a longer post...so I just picked this from my Yahoo...
34,I have a new lay-out mas bagay kasi ang colors sa geocities webpage ng kitchen ko.
34,My brother-in-law was getting married and his fiancee requested that I prepare the rolls.
34,I was looking at my collection of printed recipes and this idea was from Del Monte Kitchenomics but the original recipe did not include using celery sticks and also called for deep frying and using its famous tomato sauce.
34,Before going to the Food Exchange List something on the Nutrition Facts found in most food merchandise uniformly had this note and table: 'Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 cal diet.
34,I have been staining several pieces of pine board for our ceiling (my husband and I have been slowly building our house).
34,As much as possible I try to avoid buying mixes available in the supermarkets (e.g.
34,This is a very simple dish to prepare.
34,So How do we apply the TCR (I wonder if any reader if I have readers at all took the time to calculate her TCR.
34,I don't advise (and I try to practise this as much as I could) buying candies for the kids (but sometimes my husband would succumb to the pressures when the kids ask him).
34,There are a lot of dishes calling for beef broth.
34,I couldn't help posting about this.
39,I learned the phrase Yippy Skippy from a wonderful online friend Sunni.

37,posted by Andrew A remark here a short while ago noting how role-playing games have evolved from war-game simulations and from the desires of old-school grognards to play out the lives of their units' officers touches upon my thoughts regarding class vs. skill-based characters.
37,posted by Bruce Baugh As of this afternoon at least there is no aesthetic or critical theory of roleplaying games that can deal at all adequately with what most gamers do and want to do.
37,posted by Bruce Baugh Prose can be deceptive particularly in the hands of good writers as many of the folks hanging around here are.

37,posted by Bruce Baugh For several years friends and I have talked about doing some gaming awards of our own hoping that in simplicity and focus we can add to the ranks of awards whose recommendations mean 'Hey you should really check this out.'
37,posted by L0N Just a quick thought from the Token Retailer One of the things that has always confused me is why smaller game publishers wait till the end of the summer with GenCon for their biggest releases.
37,posted by Doc Blue Time for me to beat a dead horse briefly namely on the issue of roll-playing versus role-playing or combat versus conversation.
37,posted by Geoff The other day in a conversation Bruce commented that he has this theory that roleplaying campaigns are more fondly remembered by those involved if there are a couple of really excellent sessions and some mediocre sesssions than if the game is just consisently good.

37,posted by Geoff A couple of nights ago Bruce and I were having a conversation via email about the first of the WotC D&D Adventures for 3rd edition The Sunless Citadel .
37,posted by UrsulaV So Bruce asked me to write about what it’s like to do art for a game—how you get selected and how much time you get and what sort of revisions are necessary and so forth.
37,posted by Chad So I've been thinking of what the impact of two variants in character development are on the gameplay underlying rules and hobby in general.
37,posted by Geoff One of the common misconceptions about roleplaying games is that it is possible for a gamemaster to develop a storyline for a game session a priori .
37,posted by Geoff One thing that I have been searching for over the past few years is a set of tools to provide me with consistently good gaming.

41,When we pay a considerable amount of money (as opposed to buying the CD) to listen to a singer live I think we are cheated if and when a singer gets to the highest note of a song and lets the audience sing for him/her.
41,If abortion is legal then why is someone who murders a pregnant woman charged with 2 counts of murder Isn't this a contradiction
37,so I did it -- I went to an OA meeting -- this is the first time I have gone in 3 months and it felt REALLY right......
37,some other small subtle changes .... really it's not complex or difficult to DO .... what's challenging is getting past the process of thinking about it.... it's so very tempting to analyze think re-think re-analyze and wallow in your current existence... change seems so VERY hard when in fact the promise that lies just on the other side of that change is so so much better than where I am now..... just for today.....
37,why would God allow these feelings & thoughts fill me if something weren't missing those 'empty' feelings are rooted in childhood something you didnt get as a child it's therapy 101 i think once you figure it out and work through any negative feelings toward your parents or whatever ... then you can look at what you DO have and feel fulfilled (that's my take on it anyhow) as an adult i felt so happy when xxxx was born and then after yyyy.
37,so I am travelling again..... being on the road makes it VERY challenging to eat right always eating in resataurants and no direct control over ingredients nor portions -- however so far I think I am doing ok ......
37,so my f-i-l was in town this weekend a birthday celebration and then joined also by the m-i-l on sunday -- she always brings tons and tons of food... earlier in the day I had turned down ice cream knowing more food would be coming...
37,Okay I survived baptism and other than the beginnings of a panic attack (which I was able to fend off) nothing went horribly wrong.
37,So I'm scared to death about going to the dentist but I make myself just do it.
37,Every time I think about this trip my stomach gets knotted up.
43,Seven years in one branch is a long time.
43,Ahhh a quiet day in the branch.

13,This bug experiment could be very interesting.
13,'Disappearer' is neater than 'Fake Plastic Trees' I don't reckon so Gio.
13,Annette is an eighth-grader who rides my bus.
13,One day after school I was walking home from my bus stop when I noticed something furry in the middle of the road.
13,Maria: I think geographic feature means like near a lake or on a hill or by a mountain or something.
13,hey what are we supposed to do with geographic feature is it like if i found it under the ground or with a bunch of other rocks etc.
13,'We' being the pronoun that substitutes Annette Sarah and I.
13,I had a very interesting moment today.....here is what happened: I was in the shower and seeing as our windows have been open because of the weather there are various mosquitos in the house.
13,Why yes Maria indeed I am.
13,wow you're really taking this grammar thing on this blog seriously
13,Why I just published that last post I will never know.
13,Must share with the folkses: Mmm....just enjoyed a really fab meal.
13,'thanks giovanna your the best' Maria I believe that you intended to say: Thanks Giovanna You're the best' The manner in which you spelled the word 'your/you're' indicated that you were using it as a possessive as in 'Giovanna can you bring some more of your homemade cookies to lunch tomorrow' 'You're' on the other hand is a contraction joining the words 'you' and 'are'.
13,Maria- I sent you an improvised copy of the lab report by email.
13,hey i dont have the paper for the lab report can anyone please explain to me how you are supposed to write it
13,i believe it's due this week.
13,No I actually haven't found my rock yet.
13,no worries emily but if anybody has a scanner and would like to do me the favor of emailing me the lab report my email is penguinwittuxedo@nescape.net.
13,Oh and Maria sorry mon haven't got it.
13,FURTHER the reason you should do my research for me is because you are blessed with high-speed Internet while here I sit brokenhearted came to dump but only farted....WHOOPS Wrong show for the wrong audience....But yeah here I sit brokenhearted with an idiotic dial-up service which for your information has a speed of 49.2 Kbps.
13,c aitlin don't get your panties--or whatever--in a twist.
13,does anyone have a scanner i need the lab report handout
13,emily why should we have to do your research for you why don't YOU find out if a blackhole exploded or whatever.
13,OK several things to say: 1) Our unintentional palm tree (I promised to say more about it) happened when my uncle came to visit from--that's right--ENGLAND We bought a coconut (don't ask me why I was like 4 years old) but never ate it.
13,At Tony Chan's in downtown Miami.
13,Then my mom would get mad at me because they ate the plants.
13,I loved snails when I was little.
13,'Gio you had a pet snail That is indeed deeply cool especialy with such a name as Robert.
13,After updating (that's right Erik--updating not ^^^dating) myself upon this blog I have come to a mature decision.

13,i've had a pet rock it was cool he had a red cape.
13,waits silently until Emily blows up and yells at Caitlin for misspelling hypocrite No I've never had a pet rock although I did have a pet snail for a day.

38,The beach glows in the moonlight Waves softly coming ashore The sand beneath our feet is still warm from the midday heat Walking slowly together We pause in the moonlight And gaze into one another's soul for the longest time Carefully cupping my face in your hands Your lips gently brush my cheek Then ever so softly you press them to mine Our arms encircle one another As we draw closer I feel the heat of your body dangerously close my own Our hearts beating ever faster Until they beat as one My heart has been awakened dormant for too long I mistakenly thought this feeling One gone for many years Was lost to me forever but I now see I was wrong Your strong arms gently hold me I melt in your loving embrace Just being in your presence I feel secure and safe You whisper to me softly Your lips brushing my ear Then slowing moving downward caressing my neck Our body heat becomes intense As you pull me closer yet My mind is spinning wildly all sense of reality gone We collapse onto the damped sand Waves lapping at our feet And here two souls slowly melt into one As sand clings to our bodies We lie there quietly Sharing this tranquil moment lying by the sea

38,Oh well... not too depressing after all...
38,Election day Local elections in Italy this past weekend.
38,Singing the Anthem While freedom of expression in this country takes unexpected turns (apparently one of the points is that it's up to the Cavalier Berlusconi and his hench er collaborators to decide what is true criticism of him and his ways and what is 'aggression' 'partiality' and 'violence') and if a journalist doesn't contradict the claim that the private TV is freer than the public one the concern is not if this is true but if he smeared the public image of the firm one of the chief worries of our President of the Republic is if the Italian Soccer Team will finally start singing the National Anthem at the World Championship.

38,People have sort of taken a liking to demonstrating.
38,They appeared slowly tiptoeing into the urban landscape in days of luminous cold one by one.
38,I got some extremely good news on Tuesday.

37,Greater Things In my eyes I see the clarity of dreams so many refuse to see.
37,Stranded High Stranded high above my own illusions I glance downward towards reality and I conclude that life is better lived with a little silver smoke a glass filled with spirits some good deeds many wicked thoughts books to sharpen the mind hand gestures to keep you fit a mattress to catch you poems to get you laid roses to get you love and lot's of money to keep you stranded high away from your illusions and life's realities.
37,Morning Breath I lay quietly reflective on the crisp white sheets strewn carelessly on my bed it is early morning as the sun tries to make it's way through my curtained window I am happy peaceful gently I pull my pillow to me closing my eyes imagining the scent and warmth of his body upon mine I take breathe contentedly feeling my heart beat listening with a smile at words fluttering on the wind whispering into my being I rise thoughtful disheveled in my joy sunlight bathes my skin as I open my curtained window to find him on the breeze I inhale deeply taking love into my soul.
37,Voices It's like smelling rain weeks before a drop comes on a hot summer's day.
37,Unspoken Desires Seemingly sweet without sin on my mind I bed you take you without a soul to know I smile innocently no one to see behind my eyes I make you scream please you taste you so quiet I am it seems respectable I pretend to be without shame or sin desire racks my brain as I ravage you do things till you moan my name I am sweet innocent guilty of secret pleasures fantasies hear me feel me yes I am the pure that sighs the sweetness of your love whisper to me invade my mind with unspoken desires.

37,Toast of Tears This glass that I hold within my hands is filled with the blood of my tears.
37,Fair Heart Oh fair heart... that beats a red sun in pure blue of skies hear this daydreamers plea scratching at her canvas with ink crackled dry.
37,The Sign Says Closed My heart has lost it's whisper I sent it to my love with a message of eternity but the sign said closed when it reached the door... if by fate you come across it please send it home where the door to my heart is always open.
37,First Love The years speak vividly in this one quiet moment from a distance of time and many miles your smile your eyes take me back with a sigh I remember our laughs songs you would serenade the first kiss you sent to me on the wind of your palm youthful was our love exchanged was our hearts with just a gaze fate was understood I see you now in this photograph a boy now a grown man with a child of your own my heart swells once again with love and happiness knowing that my first love found his place in life and light in his purpose.
37,Garden Behind The Wall Framed by sturdy walls once more the door closes flowers will still smile with vibrant colors sunlight will still glisten on early morning dew and the birds will still sing joyously in their trees dreams will also still exist when the moon dances amongst the glittering stars all this beauty and love shall endure behind walls that frame my closing door and someday when kindness rather than impudence seeks entrance to the garden behind the closed door it will be then the walls will crumble and the key lost to a forever open door.

37,The Poet I see love in the valley of mist A radiant light glows in all that is true Amidst the flowers that grow of serene colour The poet sits upon a fallen tree Head bowed down he lives within his thoughts A world spins of fantastic dreams Sweet melodies echo birds scatter in flight Pen held tightly words come to life A canvas of white sits upon his lap An explosion of colour in one small black line Word after word a story is born Upon the last drop of ink he finishes in time The poet stands upon his fallen tree Softly and quietly recites his words Never a dream from which to awaken Folds his book tucks away his pen For all that is imagined in the valley of mist For only the poet brings it to life.
37,Free To Be I am a helium balloon the string attached to my toe is my lifeline... it fits nicely around his finger in a cute tight little bow he is my weight... together we are grounded and joyously high.

37,The Bones Brittle and dry artifacts of yesterday that is all left to pick at imagination and memories will be misconstrued when those who find them buried try to reconstruct lies from truth for it is easier to create and embrace a facade of beautiful false love than to rattle around in the bones of a heart buried in love's cemetery.
37,Unrelinquished Love Sometimes I wonder what would be at this very moment if I had just loved you they way I should have loved you all those years ago if I had just allowed myself to fall into your arms and dive into the warm loving gaze you so readily shined upon me if I sang with you when you sang to me where would we be what would this moment be living of only love had been free perhaps it is this the unrelinquished love that makes me wonder if we were ever really meant to be.
37,Sway If I could touch you across these miles send my love dancing across all space and time I would sway gently into your soul meld my heart to your dreams lift you to heaven as your heart your love sways dancing within me.
37,Waters The words trickle slowly into rivers flowing release escaping the oceans lapping the sands within my being.

37,Delightful Addiction Oh the sin I become languishing every moment yearning without moral becoming intoxicated with every turn I relish in the lies the glory and failures chills run down my spine in the splendor of their love addictive in sensual fervor they rile me to no end oh the mystery deceit and tribulations and yes I even laugh wickedly and bashfully secretly I inhale their scent I become jealous enlightened and powerful knowledgeable my weakness screams in the strength they bring me oh but I am human and my mind heart soul rise to greater plains in this delightful addiction stone me frown upon me accept me in dramatic flair for I am who I am to my ink stained core from cover to page to word yes I am shameless proud to be a book lover.
37,When I Fell In Love With You My heart knew the first time I saw you for it lit up shining brightly and pounded my feet into the earth it whispered to my eyes catch me I've found love.
37,This Crooked Road This crooked road that I was born cracked nor wise disguised and forlorn I cry here giving earth my tears sit under the barren branches of sorrow tree mountains vast distant as my years counting dreams I have screamed mercilessly frantically to the heavens for peace for sleep for anything my voice echoes landing alone unheard grasping at my feet this soul housed within my flesh lingers starved lost bumping into my heart on dark lonely nights I gaze tired defeated disillusioned my faith laughs for believing this crooked road will someday lead me home.
37,Road To San Francisco I sat on the bridge contemplating mourning no death my glass house trembling with me as tears stained my perfectly ironed crisp facade I sat in between yesterday and the unknown of tomorrow losing nothing leaving everything I sat high above untouchable kin with the sky calm among sand colored hills on the road to San Francisco.
37,Lead Me Away Lead me away far from what I know find me the place where kindness caresses my skin and the sun embraces my being with truth lead me away far from these walls find me the place where beauty reigns natural within and my heart beats in completion lead me away far from this sorrow find me the place where freedom gives wings to my soul and the only love is love pure in itself lead me away.
37,Fade Not Away Fade not away from me for my light is spent Hide not in the shadows for my eyes no longer seek Awaken to beautiful sounds for my voice lingers no more Smile at joyous freedom for what was becomes boxed Find the heart that becomes you for mine did not measure Fade not away from me for my light is spent of thee.
37,Almighty Love You give me words that transcend the barriers of my own flesh words of forebode of light and heaven of death of life these words I dwell that breathe their existence to me manifest within my soul create in me a light to my darkness these words that haunt spiral into my being primitive as I in bare naked truth with words you give me a gift to live under the moon and sun to speak to be to exist as one between heaven and hell with words I am free to live my heart you are the Almighty Love that created me.
37,The Diarist If you only knew the smile you bring me the rise in my heart when I see when I read your words your feelings your experiences if you only knew how much you mean to me how much you have touched my heart with the depth and passion of your life if you only knew how special you really are to a stranger so very far away who takes joy reading your words each and every day if you only knew.
37,Thread Of Love (written for my nephew) For all of life I shall carry you my heart will carve your name upon my soul And for every star in heaven's ebony night a wish I make for you If ever in this life you need a place to be the road home will guide you to me Young heart through old the thread of love will always be the light for you little boy who gave love to life.
37,Heaven's Door For a brief moment time stood still no sounds no movements all that was beat softly quietly in my chest I felt my heart and it was filled with love so many faces so much sorrow the goodbyes heavy I wondered if my soul could hold the memories or would they fade with my light I stood there too early for my time face to face with mortality with my goodness and my sins waiting to know if He was ready for me for a brief moment I discovered life it's meaning as I stood not ready at Heaven's door.
37,A Heart's Letter I strolled the fine lines the delicate curves rode on every sudden flair my heart pounded as fingertips caressed the smooth plain of this antiquated art.
37,No Need To Say Goodbye Each day I came here searching for a sign some word or breathe of your existence.
37,In Your Eyes All I saw was truth then your back it's silence spoke 'I don't care' executing me with blunt force but your eyes before you turned your deep warm eyes betrayed you when they locked into mine my every move I saw your heart sad in them wanting to love but turning instead.
37,The Lonely Storm It settled upon me crawling slowly grasping in the dark It found my heart then exhaled sorrow on my soul I held the tears heaving their weight against thoughts biting at my facade Wave after wave came crashing as loneliness stormed my tranquil being.
37,Mi Corazon (My Heart) You stood on the corner strong beautiful life tattooed on and in you.
37,Outlaw Rose Between the cracks the saw dust and tears a seed fell by chance lodging itself stubbornly into my broken heart.

43,It is Day 7 of the Athens Olympics and while I am enjoying the events I am quite ready for them to end.
40,Hey hey hey Today's show was yet another repeat.
40,It seems that The Honz is on vacation all this week.
40,(May 26 2004) Today’s show was a repeat from Thursday May 13th.
40,Today's show is a repeat from the 12th.
40,Today's show was a repeat (from 5-5-04) so there's nothing new to report.
40,Today The Honz raised the issue of Senator Kerry's 'support' of a 50 cent per gallon gas tax.
40,It's late in the day and I am tired so I'll try to make this quick.
40,Today (5/19/04) Fred Honsberger made the following claims.
40,Provocative title no This phrase has been slung around quite a bit on the 'Honsberger Live' show lately.
40,Today's program was a mixed bag as most of the hour was devoted to a non-issue the 'soaring' gas prices.
40,There's some evidence that The Honz himself has seen this blog Welcome aboard Fred Feel free to comment on anything written here.
40,Today Fred addressed the issue of the Geneva Conventions in relation to the treatment of Iraqis in the now infamous Abu Graib prison.
40,On today's program The Honz made an interesting rhetorical sleight-of-hand.
40,Thursday’s Show (5/13/04) Well I found yesterday’s show to be ‘vintage’ Honsberger.
40,The Honzman did it again today - a number of times.
40,Wednesday's Show (5/12/04) A couple of glaring misstatements by Honsberger: 1.
40,Fred Honsberger today (on his television program) stated that The Toronto Star had proven a link between al-qaeda and Iraq.
40,While not actually a LIE this story shows the level of respect The Honz holds for the truth and his audience.
40,Pittsburgh area Conservative Talk Show Host has shown himself to be a liar on many occasions.
40,There was more Moore on today's show.
40,Predictions for Today Prediction We predict that Fred will continue to misrepresent 'Fahrenheit 911' for a while.
40,Is THIS really the best they can come up with Michael Moore is registered to vote in TWO states at the same time Honsberger says it like Mikey's done something WRONG.
40,In a performance worthy of Richard Burbage himself Fred Honsberger today danced and weaved around the truth in so many ways we're still reeling.
40,Friends; We are sorry that today's posting is so late.
40,Predictions for Today Judging from Fred's rants about Michael Moore yesterday on KDKA we're pretty sure that if he's on TV this morning there'll be more of the same.
40,We don't claim Fred's radio show as regular territory for this blog but when his radio lies are particularly agregious we have to correct him.
40,Predictions for Today We don't have any particularly strong predictions for today - sorry.
40,Fred was on LIVE today and boy was he on-message.
40,Friends; Given the unofficial 'day-off' prompted by another 'Honsberger Live' rerun we've taken the opportunity to gather some views critical of Steven Hayes' book in the hope that those who plan to call in will have just a little more info to use.
40,Things we won't see today While Liz has already thought of this (and shame on her for pre-emptively plagarising us) we want to make a list of things we probably won't see on today's show.
40,With a series of callers today Fred outlined his particular theory of talk show epistemology.
40,We're keeping score here at the Blog.
40,'Honsberger Live' was indeed live this morning.
40,Many many thanks to Liz for her eye-poppingly great posts.
40,Friday's program was a repeat of a show originally broadcast on May 17th.
40,Today's show was originally broadcast live on May 14 2004.
40,Wednesday June 16 2004 What I learned from today's show: The biggest project in Iraq is getting the Internet into all the high schools.
40,As mentioned yesterday today's program is supposed to be about the 'Booming Bush Economy.'
40,Today’s show was hosted by Bob Bruce and featured two call-in guests.
40,- Don't expect any comments on the Honzman's radio program this week.
40,Honsberger must LOVE this show because this is at least the second time it's been repeated since airing only a month ago on May 13 2004.
40,We took the opportunity to listen to the honsman on the radio (KDKA-AM) this afternoon.
40,Today's program was another Honsberger Live without The Honz.
40,My Friends; Today was another repeat.
40,Alas today's show was a repeat (from May 21).
40,Predictions for Today's Topics Assuming the program isn't another rerun we're predicting that Fred (or now Bob Bruce - Hi Bob) will be discussing the Reagan funeral services.
40,During today’s show the topic turned to the love between Ronald and Nancy Reagan.
40,Well to begin with today's show was not a rerun but that doesn't mean that Fred Honsberger was on the air - he wasn't.
40,Predictions for Today's Topics We're hoping today isn't another repeat - it's much more fun exposing new misstatements than reresearching old ones.
40,Something we have yet to comment upon the SPR (or Strategic Petroleum Reserves).
40,Today (June 7 2004) was another repeated show.
40,Predictions for Today's Topics If Fred is on PCNC today I am guessing he'll spend the hour lauding President Reagan.
40,We assume that if 'Honsberger Live' is indeed live today Fred will talk about Ronald Reagan.
40,First the mundane - Fred's show was a rerun again.
40,Today (June 1 2004) PCNC broadcast another rerun.
40,Fred's still recuperating so we'll have to look elsewhere for stuff to comment on.
40,(Maybe Some of Those Retired 58 Year-olds Being Sent to Iraq) 'What a big man Fred is for inviting me to do it because our politics are diametrically opposed.'
40,Today's show was a repeat from June 30th and featured more Moore-bashing.
40,Today's program is a repeat from June 29th.
40,First off - today's program was yet another rerun.
40,Friends; We can't say that our predictions were wrong for this mornings show.
40,Predictions for Today First off we have to say that our prediction record has not been very good here at “Honsberger is a Liar.” But that does not stop us from trying.
40,Since today’s TV program was a repeat we decided to wade out into the murky waters of Fred’s radio program on KDKA-1020 Pittsburgh.
40,Today's show is a repeat from June 24th.
40,We won't be making any predictions today.
40,Today's program was for the most part a pretty blunt character assassination of Senator John Edwards.
40,Predictions for Today We imagine the Fahrenheit 911 stuff will be pushed aside by the Kerry/Edwards story although we won't be surprised if there's still some remnants of Moore-bashing on today's program.
40,Amendment I Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
40,How weary stale flat and unprofitable Seem to us all the uses of this world For the Mighty Fred Honsberger repeats A weary weedy weather-bitten hour.
40,Predictions for Today Just a short note today.
40,There isn't much to analyze on today's Honsberger Live program.
40,Predictions for Today Prediction: We are not making any strong predictions today beyond saying that Fred will probably continue in his attempts to discredit 'Fahrenheit 911' and he will probably not mention the RNC's 'Hitler Ad.'

45,Date: Monday March 15 2004 Hello everyone please read this when you can.
45,On this Memorial Day I feel that Adrian died in a battle like the soldiers we’re honoring.
45,Ok no Adrian dreams last night (Thursday) but somewhat calmer today (thankfully).
45,The only dream I had of Adrian last night was about him being mad at me He left me a cell message that I was too mean and he was leaving.
45,This is my first blog entry.
45,I like this blog link b/c it is so anti-bush.
45,A brief moment at the computer.
45,I went to sleep feeling awful (grief awful is awful magnified 1000 times) and awoke this fine morning feeling really good.
45,The overwhelming sad feelings are back today but no surprise really all part of the grief journey.
45,Short blog today still happy the clouds are out (and not the sun enough already) and happy that I played with Harry early this morning (got throwing the ball 100 times out of the way at 8 am).
45,I’m doing well again today (an odd feeling lately) strange how feeling better works.
45,In a reserved sort of way today I’ve actually felt happy (and healthy too).
45,School’s out for summer (remember that song from the 70's) yes Adrian never liked a lot of exclamation points in my writing but right now I’m saying “tough”.
45,I’ve survived one of the worst days since Adrian’s death and I’m happy to say I’m feeling much better today.
45,You won’t believe this I awoke to the same song that I awoke to 9 months ago (the day Adrian died).
45,Dreaming of life with Adrian (those were the days).
45,Ok I've made the leap I've done it and I feel somehow better.
45,No Adrian dreams but I do feel he’s here with us.
45,No ‘Adrian’ dreams last night but that’s ok two in one week seem like such a gift (that can sustain me for at least a week lets hope) I’ve been thinking a lot about Adrian’s cancer story well we called it 'our cancer story' as the whole family went through it.
45,I dreamed indirectly about Adrian last night something about ‘being in a mall (which we detest) and learning to live without Adrian I knew he had died’ type of dream.
45,Thankfully I had another 'good Adrian' dream last night that’s extremely comforting (as opposed to a 'bad Adrian' dream about him leaving me which is still comforting in an odd sort of way) But I slept badly because Harry got into my room (he usually sleeps under Rebecca’s bed) but because Rebecca left her door open (gurh) and my bedroom door is broken he can head-butt it open.
45,In honor of Adrian I owe a comment on Reagan.
45,Adrian is back Thankfully I dreamed of him last night It’s been since May 15th that I had a very specific Adrian dream and I feel so much better now Plus yesterday I got the worst headache (explosion type) and went to bed at 7 pm (Rebecca stayed up naturally).
45,No Adrian dreams making for a day where I miss him even more than usual (how is that possible).
45,Awoke with a headache and no dreams of Adrian.
45,Of all the coincidences I don't believe it I just did a google search on 'Anna Karenina' my newest book that I got for $1 at our neighborhood garage sale.
45,No dreams of Adrian directly but did have an action-suspense dream about writing a book on pedophiles (of all horrible things).
45,This was in a 'Letters to the Editor' in the PI and ordinarily Adrian and I would talk about this agreeing completely: 'I applaud no I offer a standing ovation to former Vice President Al Gore for Wednesday's courageous speech and clarion call to oust the Bush administration's parade of fools in their inept and disastrous handling of situations in the Middle East and their sinister activities to subvert the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
45,I’m free Rebecca Heather and my mom flew off late Saturday night and returned home to Cleveland (Ohio).

44,I have several observations to share with you as the resident board member.
44,It's not just the minimal time in Recovery but also the particular personalities that are going to constantly perster whomever they can with their 'cares'.
44,I have come aboard the Recovery House Blog.
44,When it is mentioned that someone is still clinging to their own will it reminds me of how I made zero progress; in fact I made regress until I finally decided that I didn't know anything especially what was best for me.
44,You have no obligation to attend to or even hear every little gripe that a resident might have.
44,This blog is brought to you by Peoria Recovery House Inc whose endeavor is to provide clean and sober living environments for people in Recovery.

44,No-one took the '...I'm going fishing...' statement seriously enough for it to be even a weak attempt to deceive anyone.
44,The difficulty with addicts is that there are multiple issues wrapped up in the addiction and post active addiction behavior.
44,The Board has long discussed the issue of a house computer and porn.
44,Does Matt have an income Could he perhaps get a cell phone or pay for an additional line at the house Getting a second line would not necessarily set a precedent for everyone due to his special needs.

44,Yesterday the house members assembled to discuss house activity and resolve issues.

44,I am very glad that you chose to offer the following facts as a rebuttal: .....but I know where there's a basement floor not ready a bathroom floor not ready a recovery house not finished a personal home not finished........
44,Much of what you say is true.

44,There is a midnight meeting at Sanity (905 NE Madison) on Friday if anyone is interested.
44,You all have been very honest with Scott about your thoughts and past experiences with this sort of situation.
44,This is not a racetrack or a courtroom where you play with peoples lives nor a classroom or university with a professor or professional teacher.
44,My experience has been that in any group situation there will be intimidation aggression et al.

44,Scott: I've been watching this stuff for 13 years and sorry but if I had to bet on a horse here Jimmys perspective is right at the finish line while your pony is being left in the dust.

44,Sorry I couldn't make the meeting.
44,Matt lost the boot sector on his hard drive so he will not be on the internet for a few days.
44,I continue to admit my defects of character you continue to point them out.

46,'When I Look To The Sky' When it rains it pours and opens doors And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love That have to say goodbye And as I float along this ocean I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me And you make everything alright And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me And I can always find my way when you are here And every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't dance before And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss And pick you up in all of this when I sail away Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly But with you I can spread my wings to see me over everything that life may send me When I am hoping it won't pass me by And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me there you are to show me So there you go then.

46,Just sitting here reflecting over the past year.
46,Sometimes all you can do is just hold on.
46,So today I spent just kicking back and not doing a whole lot of anything I have had the last four days off and tomorrow will be number five.
46,I'll be right here waiting for you: Oceans apart day after day And I slowly go insane I hear your voice on the line But it doesn't stop the pain If I see you next to never How can we say forever Wherever you go Whatever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you I took for granted all the times That I thought would last somehow I hear the laughter I taste the tears But I can't get near you now Oh can't you see it baby You've got me goin' crazy Wherever you go Whatever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you I wonder how we can survive This romance But in the end if I'm with you I'll take the chance Wherever you go Whatever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you Waiting for you If you have any questions I'm right here waiting for you.
46,One thing Oh Please Get over it I'm sorry did the director of the FCC find himself (ok here comes the obligatory pun) 'titalated' by the almost 1/4 second exposure of a woman's breast How ANAL is that I think the guy should take some time one sunny day go into the bedroom with his wife lock the door strip naked (the both of them) and with the full light of day shining on them have a frank and open discussion about the human body.
46,Here's a good place to visit.
46,Ok I have been sitting here thinking about the phrase 'making love to me' or 'make love to me' or any of the variations of that phrase.
46,Handbags and Gladrags - Stereophonics Ever seen a blind man cross the road trying to make the other side Ever seen a young girl growing old trying to make herself a bride So what becomes of you my love When they have finally stripped you of The handbags and the gladrags That your poor old Grandad had to sweat to buy you Once I was a young man and all I thought I had to do was smile You are still a young girl and you bought everything in style so once you think you're in you're out 'cause you don't mean a single thing without the handbags and the gladrags that your poor old Grandad had to sweat to buy you Sing a song of six-pence for your sake And drink a bottle full of rye Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake And bake them all in a pie They told me you missed school today So what I suggest you just throw them all away the handbags and the gladrags that your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy you They told me you missed school today So I suggest you just throw them all away the handbags and the gladrags that your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy you I love you darlin Jewel ME

46,Ever notice how our lives are now defined by commercial breaks Think about it.
46,Breathe I played the fool today I just dream of vanishing into the crowd Longing for home again Home is a feeling I buried in you I'm alright I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe And I can't ask for things to be still again No I can't ask if I could walk through the world in your eyes Longing for home again Home is a feeling I buried in you I'm alright I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe I'm alright I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe My window through which nothing hides And everything sees I'm counting the signs and cursing the miles in between Home Home is a feeling I buried in you that I buried in you I'm alright I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe I'm alright I'm alright It only hurts when I breathe when I breathe Yeah it only hurts when I breathe when I breathe Ohit only hurts when I breathe 'Breathe - Melissa Etheridge From the 'Lucky CD''

46,You cannot quit me so quickly There's no hope in you for me No corner you could squeeze me But I got all the time for you love The Space Between The tears we cry Is the laughter keeps us coming back for more The Space Between The wicked lies we tell And hope to keep safe from the pain But will I hold you again These fickle fuddled words confuse me Like 'Will it rain today' Waste the hours with talking talking These twisted games we're playing We're strange allies With warring hearts What wild-eyed beast you be The Space Between The wicked lies we tell And hope to keep safe from the pain Will I hold you again Will I hold... Look at us spinning out in The madness of a roller coaster You know you went off like a devil In a church in the middle of a crowded room All we can do my love Is hope we don't take this ship down The Space Between Where you're smiling high Is where you'll find me if I get to go The Space Between The bullets in our firefight Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you The rain that falls Splash in your heart Ran like sadness down the window into...
46,Oh for pittie's sake people say something.

41,Good morning world I am happy to report that the shower was a complete success The only other suggestive gifts had come from her girlfriends (not from parent types) (but I guess that fits because I was never very parent-y)and the one moment of 'uh-oh' came when I realized sitting right next to Alex during the gift opening was her soon-to-be grandmother-in-law from Armenia (very old school traditional and straight-laced).

48,Wandering the humid hall of the San Diego Convention Center (one wouldn't expect that such an expansive space would be humid when the air conditioning was on but the crush of bodies and electronic doo-dads conspired to make it just so) during the annual Comic Con today I was reminded about how much I enjoy the quirky habit of reading comic books.
48,I don't think that Governor Schwarzenegger calling the state legislature 'girly men' is really sexist or homophobic (some especially thin-skinned and/or opportunistically partisan Democrat even compared his use of the phrase to using the 'n word' which is so far over the top that it isn't funny.)

45,it is dark.......no she is wrong its more than dark its that total darkness... black ubchanged by shades of grey she can detect no break in the surounding inky black... scared and nervous she assess' her body from head to toe.... starting at her eyes she believes she is blinking can feel her lids drop and rise of her lids....slowly she listens head cocked to one side.......... .hearing the pounding of her heart her blood rushing through her body sounds like the echo in a shell when placed to an ear tongue slips out and moistens lips a sigh escapes her as she realises her mouth is unbound.. swallowing ... eyes widening in the dark as she feels a constriction against her throat.... raising a hand feeling a weight at her wrist also she brings both hands together allmost in prayer as she caress each metal band surrounding her wrist's feeling eyes dampen with tears slender hand reach and investigate her throat... fingers moving over the metal not yet warmed by her skin......sighing she alters position slightly she is curled allmost featolly the surface beneath hard and ungiving....turning to her back and stretching limbs feet touching a barrier smooth and well warn... moving her toes she discovers bars ....hands risinf over head she discovers yet more bars crying freely she rises to knee's knowing she is caught beyond a shadow of escape back straight she places one foot flat and presses upwards as if to stand her body half straight BANG a small cry more of shock than pain as her head connects with what must be the roof of her place inprisonment Sobbing quietly... body and mind in termoil she sits in a corner braced by the very bars that hold her captive... eyes furtively searching the darkness still total not a crack showing a break for a window or the seam of a door.

45,Eyes turn to her slowly assesing her body and looks the eyes friendly for a change she feels slight comfort at being with others that suffer as she does.
45,They stand completely still wary eyes the only thing moving looking from one to another and then to their surroundings she is in shock allmost at being able to move of her own accord but feeling the soil of the pevious night abuse she steps towards the bath in the centre of the grassy area eyes looking to the others as she moves confidently smiling as she see's her lover of the previous evening begin to follow her steps.

43,We wonder why they leave us Why they have to die.
43,What would you do if you were told 'You only have six months to live' Would you ever lose hope of beating those odds Would you ever laugh or smile again Would you pray to God above you To take you or to let you stay Would you value your life a little more Would you be thankful for each new day Would you reach out to others And let them comfort you Or would you stay deep within yourself As some people often do What would you want to be remembered for What have you done with your life Would you try to change it all now Or would you know you have lived right Does it really matter how many days we live Isn't what really matters how we live our days Think About It While there's still time to change your ways

43,Confessions Of A Broken Heart Pain...
43,This poem is to my friend Jeff.
43,The Thief Of My Heart Author: Lourdes S. Like a thief in the night you entered And robbed me And stole my heart You made me feel more love Then I've ever felt And more happiness Than I've ever dreamed I will go to the ends of the earth if you need As I never thought dreams Could come true Yet you have showed me that they do When you came and robbed my heart As I gaze into your eyes My spoken words cannot express The love I have for you I just never knew All the things I was missing From this life of mine When you stepped in And like a thief you robbed my heart and soul.
43,HOW YOU MAKE ME FEEL Author: Julia Erdan When I am wrapped up in your arms I feel safer than ever before.
43,Today is a blue day for me i have so many things on my mind right now.
43,This water getting too deep to tread I’m losing my grip getting in over my head I’d give you this breath just send me on under I’m so wrapped up in all of your wonder My hearts beating faster than it probably should But drowning has never felt so good Im weaker then Ive been willing to say But I’m falling faster every day So scared to be torn and broken again Shaking words bleed from this pen All of my walls you seem to break through I guess I’m just weak when it comes to you What is this spell that you’ve got me under It swept me up like rolling thunder You’ve got me.
43,2 in the morning and i just got off work sitting here thinking and listening to manhattans kiss and say boodbye.
43,I've tried to write these words...so many times before.To say the things that are in my heart...to the man that I adore.
43,Trying to see what makes this good But its so hard when all I can find is what I do wrong.
43,. . .If we never meet again in our lives I should feel that somehow The whole adventure Of existence Was justified by My having met you.
43,Find the hurt bind the pain nothing lost only gain.
43,Those who have suffered Understand suffering And therefore extend their hand.
43,Well let me tell you about Simon he is a guy i chat with on-line .
43,I look up at the stars and I see your face.
43,Got this in one of my emails today though it was really cute.
43,Wanted so bad It's been so long A feeling like this A feeling so strong.
43,It costs nothing and is worth a lot.
43,Betrayed by your sweetness I only saw what you wanted me to.
43,Never cry over anyone who wouldn't cry over you.
43,You will never know true happiness until you have truly loved and you will never understand what pain really is until you have lost it...Crying over someone doesn't bring them back; staying up late at night wishing on stars doesn't make things as they were.
43,My heart goes out to you Because deep inside i know Your heart is just as mine Lonelysad and unsure; Now we go through life this way Not knowing what to do You came into my life that day Now nothing will ever be the same I opened my heart to you.
43,There are many beautiful things deep inside you which this world will never understand nor listen to for neither has it the time nor the interest to care... but hold on to your peace- that peace which the world cannot give nor take away that peace so secure that you can speak your truth quietly and clearly.
43,Have you ever had times When you feel that the whole world Is against you Is against your principles Is against your beliefs Have you had times When all seem wrong never right The day seems dark The sky becomes cloudy The streets becomes muddy Have you ever felt far far away When in truth you were really very near You could have touched the stars You could even sail any storm You could even fight all your fights Well my friends I have and I know That you have too.
43,To laugh is to risk appearing a fool.
43,A time comes in your life when you finally get it.
43,I thought I'd seen Profound beauty Many times before But when I saw you My heart stopped Your dreamy eyes Revealed dignity And exquisite passion Your smile lit up My deepest emotions When you gazed at me Paradise was revealed For I'd been allowed A glimpse of heaven.
43,Saying goodbye Saying goodbye is the hardest thing i have ever done You touched my life and you touched my heart in ways that i thought were not possible as we say our goodbyes I fight back my tears is this for the best how long will it last days months or years How could something that hurts so bad be for the good It seems unreal It is something that i realize is not meant to be understood I tell myself 'it would never work'the feelings would be too deep and someone would get hurt But there is still that part of me that will not let it burn will time make it easier that is something that i will learn But as of now i think about it every day that has gone by did we make the right choice or were we stupid for not giving it a try.
43,I sometimes find I'm driftingThrough this life without effect;I often wonder if I'm trulyWorth what I've been blessed.I search through days that have been hardTo try to understandThe many trials that I have knownThe life that I have had.You see me in my daily grindSo confident and strong;Yet when I am alone I questionJust where I belong.I often try too hard I findTo analyze and guessTo scrutinize investigateMy life I will confess.For somewhere deeper there must be Some meaning to this lifeSome way to make a differenceGive a reason for this strife.Is there some hidden meaningSome agenda to be foundA greater purpose waiting If I care to hang aroundIt teases and it taunts meAlways slightly out of sight;A hazy vision out of reachWhere darkness hides the light.I struggle to bring clarityTo what awaits me thereAnd yet this weak illusionAlways fades before my stare.It seems the harder that I tryTo focus through the hazeJust serves to add more questionsThrough my endless tired gaze.Perhaps I'm trying just too hardTo understand it allFor can we ever truly knowJust what we have in storeEach incident each moment passedJust adds upon the nextBut in the end will I find truth ...Or will I be perplexedPerhaps I make it harderThan it has to be sometimesBut will my searching bring to meMy meaning over timeOr will it leave me brokenAnd confused as I feel nowWhile questions bring no solitudeTo this my wrinkled brow.
43,Today has been a good day for me.
43,People come into our lives and walk with us a mile and then because of circumstance they only stay a while.
43,'It's no trick loving somebody at their best; love is loving them at their worst.'
43,How can it be this feeling inside So cold so nothing in disguise To love to give my all to share But still alone the heart is bare.
43,A song a memoryI am transported in time A year or two younger A year or two weaker in shock in denial confused bewildered nursing a dying ember.
43,Please don’t throw empty promises Into the air It’s just too much to take.
43,To open up and love again to let someone enter your heartto take that chance ...that risk of again having your heart torn apart.I look at you and I know Just how very much I love you and wonder without you in my life just what would I do My heart has no choice but to open and let you come within I look at you and I knowI want to love again...
43,If you ever really loved someoneI mean really loved them you will always love them.
43,To You Alone I Give the Key I've tried so long and hard To make some sense of this Of what you mean to me.
43,I may seem a little crazy from time to time.
43,12:05 am just got home from work lot of things on my mind.
43,If we might have a second chance.
43,Today is a great day for me that god.

42,So here we go - my journey begins today through Andy Stanley's book Visioneering
42,I came across the following on a website yesterday.
42,Right One more day to go before I begin going through the book 'Visioneering' by Andy Stanley.
42,Barna is his book 'the power of vision' suggests that like tradition fear can be a vision killer.
42,I would love for you to post comments on anything which you have read in my blog.
42,I've been enjoying writing these blogs Not only because they have been helping me to focus on specific vision-centered themes but also because of the way specific thoughts for them have been initiated by the events of the day Two days ago after writing my blog I descended into my damp basement to look through some papers to try and find my written account of what God said to me when I was seeking Him for guidance about becoming a minister.
42,I took the day off today and went to Knowsley Safari park in Liverpool.
42,This evening was really inspiring A sharing of a vision Tonight a group of us at the Church met together to consider the vision of Wycliffe Bible Translators and how we as a Church might get involved in helping that vision to be fulfilled.
42,I spent some time today with a fellow minister and he shared with me the wonderful story of how God has guided him over the years from one place/ministry to another specifically through 'God-moments' - times when he just knew that God had orchestrated events to enable him to meet with specific people at a specific place for a specific purpose.
42,I guess most people have a favourite verse of the Bible one that perhaps brings hope encouragement a promise to claim or a challenge to face or maybe one which is linked to a specific time in their life when God led them to that verse.
42,Sometimes the task up ahead seems too demanding maybe even impossible - but if God is behind it then the outcome (and the process) may be amazing I love Monopoly I played it today against my son Luke.
42,Having written a lot over the last couple of days about my early vision for a loan company (something I hadn't expected to write about so soon into this blog) I have pondered afresh on the first promise that God gave me concerning being a visionary.
42,Some people are kept up late at night by noisy neighbours some by fear of the following day (eg dentist) some by the excitement of the following day (e.g.
42,This morning I was greeted with my two most consistent pieces of mail: an invitation to move money from one credit card to another and a low cost loan On arriving in work I booted up my PC and my first email was from 'The Motley Fool' telling me the following: IN 1997 we owed £500 billion pounds but within just 7 years it has doubled.
42,I find that when a vision begins to formulate within me it is fed by all kinds of things I encounter.
42,Yesterday I had a vision....to start a vision blog Well...was it a vision or was it just a good idea Did the vision/idea come from God How can I tell when something is a God idea or just a good idea Does it matter Cannot God just bless good ideas Hmm some interesting questions which I hope to consider in more depth as I undertake my 'vision journey'.
42,Welcome How did you get here a. I invited you and you have followed my call b. I invited someone who was so excited that they invited you c. I invited someone who invited someone who invited you d. I invited someone who....you know what I mean e. You somehow came across it whilst blissfully surfing the web f.

46,Hi Greg Fans Check out the Unofficial Greg Kelly Fan Website - www.mindspring.com/~jdpnlp If you guys have any pictures information future appearances etc...please send 'em my way from the link on the website (email jdpnlp@hotmail.com).
46,Hey Melissa- I can relate to the geek thing- I was definitely a recovering geek (still am) too.
46,Hey guys I found this page with a clip from when Rick was in Iraq.
46,GREG IS NOT STERILE His reports may be if compared to Rick's more easy going ones but he is adorable and very funny.
46,Oh no Rick's smile beats out Greg's hands any day in my opinion =) As Tom Cruise said in some movie (I think it was Jerry Maguire - maybe - I dunno.)
46,But as Greg Kelly's BIGGEST fan (Melissa will tell you) I have to object about Greg being 'sterile' he's not sterile ... and he does have a sense of humor it's a bit self-depricating (which is so identical to mine) like on Sajak's show when Sajak asked him if he had seen himself on tv Greg was like 'I'm a little queasy about seeing myself on tv at all even in peacetime.'
46,Yeah it's me Cannot get enough of Greg's long expressive fingers Leslie You know I am a Mississippi girl Shep's home state.
46,Hello from Central Illinois I found this site by accident but it is a great site.
46,Wow Greg Kelly in a tux and I missed it.
46,Well gals I think I'm going to call it an early night tonight- this day kicked my butt- to put it nicely ;) I think we may be having to wait a bit now before we see the guys again- like someone else said they'll probably really be off now for the next couple of weeks to rest up again.
46,Hi everyone Hey Melissa sorry I haven't posted in awhile hubby was across to the other coast last week in LA.
46,Lol- wouldn't you know I have a dream last night.....but it was that I was in a MALL (alluding to Rick's comment about a mall story on Pat Sajak's show).
46,Showed a photo of Greg at the White House Correspondents Dinner Saturday on Fox and Friends Fantastic in a Tux as Well
46,Greg said he watched TV when he got home.
46,Hey Jen Yeah Geg seemed shy and maybe tired.
46,hmm if Greg's not working for fox next week maybe he can laugh at my e-mail's.
46,Greg seemed shy Sally (I'm just asking I didn't watch them tonight) well what did he say just like the cliff notes version.....
46,Really down because I fear they will be totally absent this whole next week.
46,My hubby also wants to change the channel now that my 'embedded hot reporter' is off....and I'm like 'what if they come back' and he said 'they said goodbye they're not coming back'- (LOL when he was saying it).
46,What did I tell ya Boy did I get the third degree- but in a kidding kind of way My hubby doesn't understand why I think Rick is attractive- he said I should like the 'Kelly guy'- LOL He kept saying Eccleston was hot- but I know he was just joking to kinda poke fun- that's ok. Well at least that's out now :D Oh yeah....he said that he thought Rick jumped in everytime Pat asked a question- like trying to beat Greg to the punch.
46,HE CAN'T SAY WHAT HE DID WHY of all things would he say that.
46,What did ya'll think about Sajak Rick could not say what he first did when he got home Ha bet we can imagine.
46,Is everyone ready for Sajak tonight I have my VCR/tape set to go I just have to explain WHY I'm taping it.....that should be interesting Alisha- it was me that asked what part of CA you're in- my sister lives in San Diego- about a block or so from Pacific Beach.
46,it's 3:50 a.m. est and I've just been near concussed by the end and underside of a table but luckily I am still am able to recall who -] is ... now if Melissa could tell me who 8) is...
46,Hey Lynne over at Small Victory you said you saw Rick's girls do the weather on Fox & Friends.
46,Oww Leslie - hope that Darvocet is doing the trick for you I've broken both my ankles and it's no fun hobbling around on crutches.
46,I think it's time to do some shopping....in the Fox News Store I think I've been watching waaaaay too much......I wish they had some Rick stuff.
46,Hehehe....you know you're in too deep when you see a Fox ad with Rick in it and you stand stock still and stare until it's over....sigh Thank God there's the video clips at Fox Fan Central Do you guys watch Friends Thurs.
46,You wanna know how silly I am Leslie When I first read your post I was like 'what does painting a garage have to do w/breaking your leg'
46,8) BOOYAH 8-0 'booyah's my word' -] Jen don't laugh at my 'booyah'
46,Hey ya'll just a quick tip: if you're ever painting the trim and eaves around your garage DO NOT fantasize about an all-nude Studio B with Rick and Greg appearances.
46,Hi there Greg and Rick Lovers.
46,This is the funniest thing Melissa has heard all day: Me: Honey (what's his face) can you buy me a trashy fling er flashy ring hahaha happy weekend everyone
46,OK- one last post before I head home- I put Rick as my wallpaper on my computer at work.
46,The following systems are experiencing trouble: System: Internet Access Internet e-Mail - OUTGOING ONLY HA Now I know it must be on my end ;p
46,I guess since you're all talking about signs and birthdays I'll fess up.
46,Melissa- I don't see the comments yet but our system here is kinda funky this morning I think.
46,Guinnevere - I didn't even bother ordering the tape since you said you had to order by day and time -- HUH Like I'd be able to pick you know how much money it would cost me to buy all of them -- a lot =) I hope they have a tape or dvd at a fairly decent price with all his reports.
46,Melissa- did you order the Iraq coverage tape Did anyone else try that too If so did they call you to find out what day/time you wanted the coverage for That really threw me- I'm so bummed They've GOT to put out a tape eventually of all the embed coverage....
46,'Morning Ladies I have no idea what is going on with our internet at work today but I can't see the comments on the blog- are you guys having the same problems I'm not sure if it's site specific or our connection here at work.
46,Hey girls I had to check the Blog before I started my morning.
46,MELISSA: Did you read Leslie's post about the reserve gig... AGRH I did it again I'm going to go under a rock and hide now ....
46,I think Shep would love to do his show in the nude and was just baiting us when he said that.
46,Hey guys Did anyone catch Studio B this afternoon I can't believe Shep actually thinks no one would watch his show if he did it in the nude especially if Rick and Greg were on with him.
46,I don't think that I'm going to catch the Pat Sajak show this weekend -- so watch w/ wonder for me -- hey question - is Jennifer Ecc'll whatever still in Baghdad Or is going to be in studio distracting Greg and Rick.... nighty-night everyone
46,Good Evening Foxy Ladies looks like the beautiful boys will be on Pat Sajak Sunday night.
46,Ok here's the dream I had about Rick last night It was very odd: I was standing in this school auditorium next to Rick's camera guy 'cause RIck was doing a story there.
46,I'm also in CA and I feel so ripped off I don't get to see F&F because it's just way too early to get up for me.
46,Well LevenGirlies (& GregGirlies) I think I'm going to have to take the night off- I'm beat.
46,Hey Suzi (& everyone else) I love Sean Hannity too He should definitely get a 31-day calendar page And what about our 'Old Man' - Ollie North I just ordered his autobiography & it has some old photos of him on the Navy boxing team and in Viet Nam.
46,Ooooh.....I wonder if he's ever in SF- for THAT I'd call in sick for work....IF I knew where he was going to be that is (special story interview etc....) Hmmmmm......sinks into daydreams
46,Ya know....I wonder why Rick was in Chicago (other than to do Mancow which he could have done by phone) He sure is busy for just being back ;) HE would be about the only reason I would get on a plane (i.e.
46,I tried and tried to cal into Fox and Friends yesterday to ask Rick and Greg if they knew that they had become 'sex symbols' for the FoxNews junkies like us but all I could get was the busy signal.
46,BUMMER On my post last night I said that I'd ordered the Iraq coverage with the embedded reporters (from the Fox Fan video/transcrips) for 34.95....well they just called and it's by date & time....so I cancelled it for the time being.
46,Hey girls I'm at school but about to go to work.
46,Turns out the whole Kansas City area that has Comcast cable internet was having problems.
46,Okay I hope this is the link to the transcript of Greg and Rick on H&C the other night.
46,I'm at a loss without Rick coverage this morning.....they spoiled me I taped Fox & Friends but I notice that they have been having them on at the end and they weren't today.
46,Just typed a long message twice and can't post it
46,I am somewhat computer illiterate after all you know I am the grandmother of the group.
46,OK I am computer illiterate I don't know how to post the link to the transcript from last night but here's how to get it GO to Fox News.com Fox Fan Central search on Greg Kelly the third item that appears is the transcript 'Fox's Brave Journalists'.
46,Sally- Thanks for posting that :) Do you mean the H&C segment they were on I only found that one (where Rick mentions Shep's cat).
46,Oops it's the transcript from last night's Hannity and Colmes.
46,Hey ya'll just printed a partial transcript of this morning's Greg and Rick from the FoxNews site.
46,Hey guys my internet is being seriously spastic right now.
46,Operation Playmate.com -- did anyone hear about this in on O'Rielly Factor Apparently Playboy Playmates are sending the troops pics autographs etc etc I guess it's good that Rick and Greg got out before they could log on right
46,Hi Lynne Adrain Paul has a new show that's kind of strange.
46,Andrea: My b-day is Sept. 23 ... my 'embed rehab' didn't last very long did it lol -- neither did my 'no checking my e-mail' thing either -- I don't know about Shep's datin satus -- Jane Skinner seems sweet for him during her whole 'Skinnersvile' thing ... but her diamond ring was blinding me so I wouldn't read too much into it though ....
46,Been awhile since I checked in.
46,OK- so I'm checking out the rafting tour info and check out these rapids names during the trip: Troublemaker Satan's Cesspool Bouncing Rock & Hospital Bar.....what the LOL And this is the Class III one- LOL Looks like fun though I need to find out from our broker which company it is and then look 'em up.
46,I was just at dc101 and in the What's New section is an interview site under construction I hope that's it or he will get another email (Elliot).
46,Dangit I'm getting irritated with ELLIOT at dc101.com They STILL haven't posted the interview.
46,Teri I Missed Fox Report tonight but guess all is well 'cause I didn't miss Rick.
46,Jan- even about serious stuff you're funny :D Yeah I think you'd prolly have to be in a 3rd world country to have chickens in the hospital-lol At least I could easily see them there.....I miss those 'Rick-isms'.
46,OK my company left at 3:45 I ran to Fox to catch the Fox Report and NO RICK He best be on tomorrow.
46,One good thing about working in a hospital pharmacy is that if we should ever be attacked by nerve gas we have military issue epi-pens.
46,I ordered my khaki skanky desert boonie hat :D I ordered from South Summit - I believe that was one of the ones that Melissa listed.
46,Natlie and Leslie - I just read the e-mail I got back from the IQ test and it said I'm an 'Inspired Inventor' That doesn't make sense though because I'd have no clue as to what I could possibly invent.
46,Jan- Exactly my thoughts I always told my Grandma something similar to that.
46,Nat-Thank goodness for air-conditioning no matter the humidity level.
46,Jan - Thank you thank you thank you thank you.
46,Oh my ...dah I just took a look at the posts and saw I posted two the same.
46,Jan- Yeah that's what I told the girl who got the call- I said that I didn't care if he has Dr before his name or MD after- NOT cool at all.
46,Leslie-I vote for you to stay too I think we are reaching beyond just Rick anymore (but he still owns my loyalty) and I kinda like Shep it would be a sad day when we stopped talking about him too.
46,I was going to do the IQ test but found that I already had- I was 127 and I'm an 'Insightful Linquist'...and...'The first thing we can tell you about that is you have the natural fluency of a writer and the visual and spatial strengths of an artist.
46,Melissa - I got sucked into the IQ test and emerged with what little grey matter I have left smoking.
46,Melissa- I love those tests LOL- I did the 'which Friend are you' one & no surprise to me I was Monica.
46,Did anyone else catch G Block tonight It's official Shep proclaimed clowns creepy.
46,Teri - OK you caught me I'm his girlfreind.
46,Well girls no answer to my third letter.
46,Nat - We go rafting on the Rio Grand (Taos Box Taos NM).
46,Oh girls I'm so glad it's Friday- it's been a day from hell already & it's only noon.
46,Leslie- You sure know how to make me LMAO Of COURSE you're still welcome It wouldn't be the same without you Hmmm....good question- we have a dinghy so the guys could hang out in there- lol It's funny- we don't have many places to sit- the dinette seat is covered with food (packaged that is) and we have a recliner & a papasan chair (I know I know- 'on a boat Yes on a boat...hey the main salon's pretty good size).
46,Morning I hope today isn't a Rick day.
46,Good Morning Ladies Well I'm off to the beach until Monday.
46,Thanks Ellen SO VERY MUCH for that site As I kept reading I kept thinking 'That's me I feel those things I do that' I have never felt so strongly about something as I do photography.
46,Melissa- it is www.nlford.com - not 'h' but an 'n' sorry about that.
46,Janice L - you could be right here... maybe asking some of those questions in our dreams is okay (maybe) but (now I just have to put on my former 'teacher hat' here - sorry)...
46,Melissa-you crack me up My e-mail secrets.
46,I'm beginning to feel odd-girl-out tonight.
46,Ok like Natalie - must.....tear.....myself....away I'm going to watch 'Finding Nemo' tonight I Oh thought of another question for Rick: What's your favorite movie or movie genre OH What's some of your favorite songs right now
46,I think it's time to send the questions in Sherry- I'll have to check those out Brain fade.....Leslie- did you know when Shep's b-day is I found it on MSN Group FNCC site- it's January 14th.
46,Jan - Congrats on Rick's reaction to your poem.
46,SILLY What is your hat size Would you ever date a crazed fan Do you think clowns are cute or creepy SERIOUS Has your personal opinion ever interferred(sp) with your ability to report a story What is a typical day for you How much can you bench press (sorry)
46,oh Jan LOL sorry a domain name is a site that's like www.rick-leventhal.com or www.foxnews.com You see rickleventhal.blogspot.com is a SUB domain.
46,Nat - I know when I was writing I wanted to sound mature and stuff but I'm not very good at putting my thoughts to paper.
46,Natalie I emailed him again too I got brave and asked him whatever happened to his floppy hat.
46,Melissa I am so computer illiterate that all I read was 'hey I got a fun idea blah blah blah....rick-leventhal.com What do you gals think' Whatever it means as long as I can stay I say sure.
46,oh I'll have to post the link to the Todd Connor site once it's up.
46,That would be great And then you could include a link from this one to that one (unless you can move the whole thing....) that way if he is checking in he won't be thrown for a loop.
46,hey I got a fun idea I could register a domain name specifically for this blog That'd still let me have a fun and creative domain while still having rick-leventhal.com What do you gals think
46,OMG Jan That's AWESOME OK- when we get our photos we gotta scan them and get them to Melissa so she can post- or if you don't have a scanner maybe you could mail a color copy to Melissa so she can scan & post LOL- puke I thought I was going to scream with glee when I saw it (and this was 7 AM in my office....) lol OK gals I just know he's gotta be reading our blogs and just getting such a kick out of us Amen Jan- Teri you ask the questions He's got your number- LOL LMAO Girl you're too funny You're on a roll tonight :D :D :D Ya know our group reminds me of a larger version of the Ya Ya Sisterhood.....hmmmmm.......the Floppy Hat Sisterhood the Levyfan Sisterhood c'mon- I'm sure we could come up with something- especially if we get the handshake- LOL Hey- I found out there's going to be a www.toddconnor.com site- I subscribed so I would know when it's up.
46,Melissa he'd be a fool to turn you down for an interview just tell him if he refuses we will make up the answers for him and I'm sure he wouldn't want that.
46,Oh Leslie maybe that rogue band of Jewish dressmakers also makes satin Emb-bedding.
46,YAY Jan - WHOO HOO us LevenGals are Kickin' some ass LOL ROFLMAO Levites - floppy hat and no showers Hey my fasite does say 'In Rick We Trust' LMAO
46,I haven't asked for a picture yet.
46,I got a signed picture on the way WayHoo I emailed him the poem and he thought it was 'clever definately worth a signed photo'.
46,Lynne- LMAO- I know what you're saying But it's a good thing you kept it 'clean' and professional-- I prolly scared him off by suggesting the restaurant- too personal LOL First I praised his work and then I asked (well ok maybe begged would be the better term to use)- I told him it would truly make my day if he would send one.
46,Ladies I just got the guts to email Rick.
46,While I love The Pulse I don't know if I can tolerate to watch this Mike Tyson interview.
46,hmmm got me thinkin' Shep does kind of have eyes like a cat.
46,Hey Shep fans: found a quote about cats could be a reflection on Shep's style to say just the right things.
46,Ellen I can't get anything with that URL I even tried hlford.com to see if I could search on there but I can't.
46,Melissa - while hunting the net for info on Mal James I came across this site.
46,squeeeeeeeeeeeals Teri I'm soooo jealous of you TWO in one day He must be suffering from boredome We should entertain him Girls I think we have a bored stud muffin on our hands It's ok we'll devour him in a matter of minutes heh heh The lack of Rick on tv has definately been made up with your e-mails Thank you very much Ellen I love photography very much and I've been trying to work on my site to add more of my more recent photos but I've been so busy with this site work and having issues with my personal site - it's like the hours melt away.
46,Okay I just sent my email off to Rick.
46,Melissa- just dropping off a note about your photographs.
46,OK girls I'm the woman kiss the hand that typed the e-mailLOL I got a second e-mail from Rick today...the boy is bored he's got to be.
46,Teri the poor boy will never speak to us again.
46,Melissa - I also sent Shep an email asking him to have Rick guest on his show.
46,I'm going to try again This time the satan server kicked me off the net after I typed a good portion of my post Ok we're going to hopefully find out where Rick is I emailed him again asking 'where he was levengal cult looking for him' tell fox to put you to work...Yada yada.
46,'Even though it might be unimpressive in size some good news you'll be hearing today could put you in a happy frame of mind and brighten your outlook'.---OK this was part of my horoscope today- I take this to mean that my signed picture should be coming today- LOL- where's my damn picture (In case Rick actually checks this blog out- I'm just kidding- honestly) I'm really not the most patient of people- if you couldn't tell already Leslie- You're on girl Name the time & place- LOL :D I'm sorta squeamish- it depends.
46,Welcome Ellen Fobbe I am also an Ellen.
46,Teri you can go back and fix it.
46,YAY Teri LOL he knows he has a cult following He's probably staring at the computer going 'These girls are crazy and I have to e-mail them back.
46,I got a reply thanks for writing it's gratifying to know people were watching and appreciating the hard work we all put in.
46,LOL Leslie I'm amused by little things.
46,Melissa - Didn't Shep call his late night chats with Rick Levy at Eleven How about levy@eleven for your site name Yes I did call Mr. Baier a Koala so I guess that makes him a Koala Baier.
46,This is my first post I tried last night but did something wrong.
46,Melissa - I think it is great you are getting your site going.
46,I love you girls I could be having the worst day and come here an always be cracking up by the end of the night Leslie LMAO 'satin rules' ahhhh just love that these kids are going to actually grow up and become adults one day.
46,Nat I'd trade you ten Todds two Levy's and a Rosenblatt for a Shep.
46,LMAO Teri Heh heh- it does make me wonder what is going through his mind about all these emails he's getting I'm hot now but that's 'cause I was working out trying to work off the heavy lunch I had today.
46,Lynne-just saw your blog as I signed off.
46,Do not I repeat do not get Juno My mom's bloody provider once again kicked me out of writing a blog to inform me that I got mail.
46,I am glad to know I am not the only one who thinks they should stop with all this Laci Peterson stuff.
46,Sherry- I definitely think we need to nicely assault TPTB at Fox to get Rick on more often.....I do remember seeing her more lately than since the war- more often than Rick anyway ;p. Jan- (and whomever suggested this before as well) you're probably right- Fox may have him covering the elections next year....but here's a giddy thought for ya'll.......can you imagine if Rick covered it He'd be all over the place on Fox.
46,Today was a great day for Greg's Grrrrls I'm convinced now that Fox has Rick locked in the basement.
46,Leslie-LOL-Satin Rules that brought a very vivid picture.
46,I was just watching The Fox Report and I saw a story that Heather Nauret (sp) did and I don't know if anyone else has noticed but she has been on a lot lately and she reports from New York also.
46,Wow- there's a few posts today.
46,Melissa - I like your sketch.
46,oh my god I think I'm going to start balling I was working on my Ginny picture.
46,Hey gals been a really long day for me.
46,Dangit- I lost my post from earlier.
46,Wow look at me 2 posts in one day -- must be the near ten hours I've got w/o percocet ... well the dr. said drink more so I have it might not sound like a lot but I've drunk like 1 1/2 cups of water which is a lot since my new 'pouch' is aprox.
46,OK- this is weird- at home I have the split blog.
46,At the risk of injuring Jen just had to say that the seafood-stuffed manicotti in white wine cream sauce came out rather well.
46,Good Evening Ladies Just finished my last day of work and I just got to see Adam on The Fox Report so I'm very happy now especially since I missed Rick last night.
46,I GOT MY PIC TODAY I think it's the same pic that Denise and Lynne got same funky tie but cute goofy grin I love that grin.
46,hey guys .. thought I'd give an mid-evening post today -- well today as yesterday was no good and not because Taco Bell has a new Chicken Ceaser Grilled Burrito no today was no good because I was so DAMN TIRED I've had 100% no energy -- i was exhusted taking a shower even walking out my bedroom door to the staircase (which trust me is like 10 steps max) I called my surgeon at 6:30 and he's like 'It's 6:30 why are you just calling me now' he thinks I might be a little dehydrated (SP) because I sleep so much and therefore can't drink a lot so as soon as a half hour passes it's nothing but liquids liquids liquids for me -- I know you all are dying to know what today's menu turned out to be: 4 tiny mouthfulls of baby pears for breakfast 2 baby spoonfulls of sugar-free peach jello for lunch 1 1/2 tsb of mac n' cheest for dinner I know I was suppose to have beef stew today but it didn't turn out the way I planned oh well just...49-48 more days until my grilled cheese heaven I got to talk to Leslie today :) I told her to eat a 'senisble' meal for me at dinner... Just a cautionary tale: Percocet Enrique Igelasis CD and thoughts of Greg Kelly with a cameo by Rick Leventhal can make your dreams pretty damn intresting and strange
46,Melissa and ah - I agree that keeping this blog for ourselves is a sound idea.
46,Dangit dangit dangit 3 trips to the PO & still no photo I guess I'm getting my exercise though- it's 6 blocks round trip from my office & takes me 10 minutes total each time (I walk very fast- I'm one of those people- lol I don't know the meaning of walking slow....) Argh.
46,Wow This is my first time back in days and everything's changed Toto We're not in Kansas anymore First things first.
46,Gah I was in the middle of typing a long post and my computer decides to freeze up Nat - you're not seeing a divided screen I do.
46,That's weird- the blog looks like it did after they did the update (no divided screen to see the posts as you type).
46,Good Monday Morning Ladies Well this is one Monday morning I am happy to have here since it is my last day of work.
46,Hey gals I've been busy with my sister visiting all weekend we really didn't do anythiny special.
46,Melissa I'm with Natalie I'm not sure of the difference between message boards and blogs.
46,Hey guys... Not a very good day for me today :( -- too many Pizza Hut commericals on today -- I said aloud 'I would kill someone for a slice of pizza' 50 more days until I won't have to hopefuly -- well cought up on my Factor from last week and Melrose know watching other things -- watched Old School today -- it was soo funny :) and so painful since laughing is not really a good thing -- well I took a percocet around 8 and it needs about an hour to work ... guess what it's kicking in...you guys have a great night -- tomorrow I'm having mussy beef stew Later gals
46,How sad- they're just reporting that Katherine Hepburn died today- she was 96.
46,Melissa- girl it sounds like you've been BUSY I kinda like the blog format- I guess I'm used to it.
46,Hello everyone Well I'm back from my camping trip.
46,Melissa - I'm perfectly satisfied with a blog but have no objections to a message board.
46,Morning ladies I've been up all night so I'm on like this delusional insomnia high.
46,Jan- Bummer I was really hoping you would have received yours today Monday....maybe Monday.....LMAO did he capitalize It was another warm day here- around 85+ today.
46,Denise how exciting it makes me think he DID clean his desk.
46,ARGH Why are there so MANY food commericals on tv -- I went for my daily walk w/ my mom today and was like 'mom - no walking on July 4th I can't stand to smell cookouts' I'm just looking forward to the end of my 8 week puree from hell menu -- I'm having a nice grilled cheese sandwich and maybe a sliver of BBQ Chicken ... today was a so-so day for me a lot of 'wound' pain but one crushed percocet every 6 hours seems to do the trick ... let's see for today it was: 1 tsb of baby oatmeal and 2 tsb of baby pears for breakfast 2 crackers and 2 cheese cubes for lunch 2 crackers with peanut butter for dinner mmmmmmm I found out some good news today -- not only will I eventually be able to eat salad but a nurse who had the same surgery told me that eventually I'll be able to eat .... mouth watering FILET MIGNON because it's tender ugh counting down the days until I can 'eat' again 51 days....
46,LOL- I had intentions of getting the cleaning done first before I came back to the computer but just haven't been able to resist checking in (and downloading some Tori Amos songs).
46,Nat I just read your post so I'll give you a little detail (the best I can).
46,Denise I'm so excited for you But.....wails WHERE'S MINE Oh I really really hope so Oh good Lord it's going to be forever till Monday LOL I've NEVER so looked forward to MONDAY hoping hoping hoping it's there.......please Pretty please With a ......oh nevermind- I won't go there So what did he say on it You're holding out on us ;-D LOL- I've joked about curling up under my desk to hide/sleep but I'd never actually do it.
46,I GOT MY PICTURE Just decided to check the mailbox dreading to see what bills I got and there was a manilla envelop hand addressed from Fox News he even personalized it The postmark is 6-26 so if you ladies don't get yours today it is on its way Hope everyone is having a good weekend so far(mine just got better).
46,Melissa- Yeah- I love 'Life in Mono' There is just something so great about that song- the music the words- awesome.
46,Nat - I've never heard the 'Great Expectations' whole soundtrack but I ADORE 'Life in Mono' by Mono that is like one of my absolute favorite songs And dont even get me started on Mouling Rouge.
46,Ok now I know I hate this mine just posted itself too and I wasn't ready.
46,Hi Gals sounds like everyone here is having such a hard time at their respective jobs this week.
46,Hey I like this muuuuuch better :-D Jen You're writing You sound like you're doing good- I'm glad you're on your way to recovery :-D I couldn't imagine eating only what you listed- wow.
46,hey guys Typing a little slow here but made it home in a couple of pieces j.k.
46,Hey my post just published by itself Apologies if anything is spelled incorrectly or doesn't make sense I didn't get to proofread.
46,Hello ladies I have been so busy the last few days (some play some work) Just got to see Greg I had just turned on the tv too lucky me Anyone else notice Shep takes a lot of Fridays off He gets to start his weekends early.....what a schedule...of course he probably works a lot of hours everyday that he is there (much more than we see on tv).
46,Melissa- I'm so glad you heard from Jen & that she's doing fine.
46,hmmmm I'm not sure how much I like this new blogger it's awful small.
46,OMG did anyone see the G Block today.
46,Good Evening Everyone It was a roasting hot one on the east coast today.
46,Jan- I just saw your post.
46,Ok- before I reply I have to vent a little- I'm even more inspired now to write that book after today.
46,All this talk reminds me of a country song by one of my favorite singers Collin Raye called 'Not That Different'--'I laugh I love I hope I try I hurt I need I fear I cry and I know you do the same things too so we're really not that different me and you.'
46,Hi ladies Does anyone think that Rick could be on vacation this week With summer here and news in NYC so slow this would seem to be an opportune time to take off.
46,Holy cow this looks so different I liked it better when I could easily see what people have posted so I could respond.....can't do that anymore as far as I can tell so I guess I'll be doing the split screen thing.
46,Sherry I'm sorry about the blog.
46,Denise as Sherry mentioned on yesterday's Fox Report Greg was wearing that yellowish/camel colored shirt.
46,OK- here we go again with the horoscope: 'Regardless of the weather the day may have special appeal for you especially this afternoon when a sense of euphoria lightens your spirit.'
46,I am so mad right now.
46,Hey girls I know it is late but I am still on my music high from Pearl Jam they are simply AMAZING live.
46,Ellen- Good to see you posting It was me who likes Todd (as well as Rick)- I still can't believe I missed him today.
46,The Young Ones was my sister's favorite show.
46,i don't post much but i read that Nan thought she might be the oldest in here - nada - i graduated in '70.
46,Geek Alert-----I never really listened to the radio much until high school before that it was mom's records...Barry Manilow The Lettermen John Denver etc so I didn't experience the great 70's music until about the 90's.
46,Lynne- my favorite was Roger too Then after he left it was Simon.
46,oh Duran Duran...I went to their concert here St. Patrick's day 1983 It was wonderful.
46,Melissa- hope you're feeling better Did you finish HP yet :-D
46,Sherry- LOL- I know sob you'd think I'd recognize his voice by now....I heard the report and was kinda down the hall when I heard him say 'Todd Connor' and by the time I got back he was gone- so I heard 'im but didn't see 'im.
46,Nan - a longer brief note your attempt at humor was neither feeble nor was it flat.
46,Hi Everyone Jan - you can relax - you're not the eldest member of this group - I think I probably have that distinction as I graduated in ... gulp '75.
46,Wow so much to say... Read the postings this morning in tears from laughter from emotion Jen you are truly the little sister I always wanted and never got (stupid vasectomy).
46,Hey- check out a blurb from my horoscope for today: 'Regardless of the weather the day may have special appeal for you especially this afternoon when a sense of euphoria lightens your spirit.'
46,Good Morning Ladies Wasn't on the computer much last night so there are a lot of post to read.
46,Awww Jen we'll miss ya :) I'll be thinking of you first thing in the morning and I mean FIRST thing LOL I'll just be waking up at 6:30.
46,hey ladies It has been a really long day but at least Mad Monday is almost over No firemen today it is a shame since it was really hot here and they could have gotten the hoses out and.....I'd better stop there.
46,Jen- I have to laugh at the way you look at time 'cause I think the same way- I think backwards to make sure I have enough time for everything I need to do in the AM- and I'm even worse when it's before something out of my regular routine.
46,lala hey guys -- just got done w/ my near nightly 'therapy' session w/ Leslie lol -- Dr. Leslie was brilliant as always :) I just got my first 'batch' of vitamins for LIFE today -- the salesclerk was like 'would you like to join our member club and become a prefered customer' I was like snatch check this out: DAILY: 2 multivitmans - 4 calicum tablets - 2 Iron tablets - 1 B-12 vitamin - 2 protein shakes and since this surgery comes with the risk of my hair falling out a special lil' pill to help 'stunt - not completely stop' hair loss ..
46,So Mr. Smith Goes to Prison....wasn't that a movie or something Wouldn't it be nice to be the one to do the frisking...'Up against the wall and spread 'em' I like the sound of that...then you'd get the cuffs out....Only thing better would be if he went on the 'buddy' system with Rick...:-) No Hannity or Skinnerville today...I missed those I like when Shep interacts with those two... Our summer went from nice to naughty overnight yesterday was sunny and warm perfect for sitting out and reading but today the humidity started kicking in and will probably be with us forever now...'It's not so much the heat....' Thank God for central air A no Rick day goes a long way in making the humidity worse...PU-No pic today Nat I sure hope they were sent this time but I will suck it up and email him if when and if it becomes necessary...'Dear Rick have you cleaned your desk yet' Leslie-I hope the weather has calmed down for you I hate lightening....to this day it freaks me out.
46,All this talk about books got me thinking out of the last 5 books I've read two were Bill O'Reilly's and the other three had heroines with interesting occupations: New York homicide detective bounty hunter and vampire executioner.
46,Jen- Good luck on your surgery.
46,Hey guys...had my LAST doctors apt.
46,Melissa- I broke down & bought the new HP book- earlier than I thought I would In the end I got it for 50% off since I have one of those B&N discount cards.
46,Sherry and Nat I grad '87 too.
46,Hello ladies I'm baa-ack So much has happened where to begin Roy snuck in Thursday night with a bottle of award-winning Texas Merlot and a baroque pearl choker.
46,Good Afternoon Ladies Well a miracle has happened and it is sunny and 91 degress in Maryland.
46,Good morning everyone Hope everyone is having a good Monday.
46,Morning Ladies I'm home today and I feel like crap.
46,Jan- I think we're prolly in the same age group- I graduated in 86.
46,Greg was on Fox&Friends this morning still in the Gaza.
46,damn damn damn I come here to post and catch up and what happens I MISS Rick's report Well I'm back everyone.
46,My vibes must have worked Just as I was about to flip the channel I heard John Gibson say 'Here's Rick Leventhal with the story' It was obviously taped earlier but it was about the guy who was losing his pulitzer (sp) from the NY Times.
46,Leslie - Disney movies on NyQuilLOL Like the Adamaniacs name but I think he deserves something little more revered than a cup for his 'family jewels'.
46,LOL Jan I was thinking the SAME thing about Shep....man he told us his time and route to work....it'd be so easy just to bump into him if I visited NYC again.
46,I just read that article on Shep thanks for the link Nan and thank your son for helping you.
46,Jan - 'look something shiny' LMAO You know that'd probably work on me....so sad I know.
46,Hey guys back for one more time.. Jan: Got your e-mail relief thanks for the 'no worries' it reminded me of Outback Steakhouse (soon I'll be there...) Melissa: WTF is up with AIM frustration for what the time we did get to talk it was really fun (really delayed lol) but fun ...
46,Hi Gals---I'm really NOT liking this non-split-screen thingy I just read the posts and laughed through most of them but for the life of me I can't remember a word I just read except ironically enough ADD.
46,All my LevenGals are MIA tonight....and no one is on AIM either.
46,Evening guys Had my last group nutritional class ... found out that I lost the most weight of people in my class happy dance There were long posts while I was gone - trying to respond Melissa: I hope your mom got your tea :) I'm about to have some soon (I just got back from dinner - meatballs w/ speghetti sauce) Nan: I woke up today thinking it was Friday - I was disapointed when I found out it was Thursday so I'm going to be happy for Friday for the both of us ... Great article by the way Sherry: I too like Greg's hair when he gets it cut - Leslie and I figured out that's where he was all day yesterday Leslie: I hope Wonderland Park was/is fun.
46,Sympathy and get well wishes to all of the ailing.
46,Just a quick post.....got to looking at B.Dalton (yeah I know....) and got back with 10 min.
46,Hey ladies I tried to post this morning but it ate my post gave me an error page and kicked me out.
46,Jen - I just saw Greg on Studio B and your right he did get a haircut.
46,OH goodness Shep is on a roll today.....or maybe it's just all this cough medicine going to my head.
46,Jan 'those who talk together stalk together' LOL I think since hotmail is affiliated with MSN that we're probably having the same problems with not getting e-mails.
46,Is it Friday yet Work not going so good today.
46,Adam Housley Alert Adam is on Fox right now talking about the California election.
46,Well I finally sent my email to Adam.
46,OMG I just watched The Fox Report last night and saw Adam's bullfighting story.
46,Hey everyone Here's a part of my horoscope today: 'Your aspirations are strong this morning.
46,Adam Alert He was on Fox News Live about 10:35 am covering the CA Governor race.
46,Hey Guys... Checkin' in late today - today has been a pretty 'blah' day for me so I haven't felt like doing much of anything...
46,Denise I can sympathize with you on the bronchitis thing I got it really bad several years ago it is miserable I was off work for a week and had the cough for about 6 weeks.
46,Hi ladies I found out that I may have bronchitis (sp)lovely I had some chest pain yesterday and had to go to the dr.
46,Natalie - The 'family jewels' remark was typical of Shep's wit.
46,HUH Rick was on I turned on the TV about the time you posted.... (and even though I set my VCR- somehow I must've miscalculated & ran out of tape before FR).
46,Argh I go outside to my garden for just a few minutes and when I come back inside Rick is ending a segment on Fox Report.
46,Well girls Adam Housley's segment got bumped.
46,Today's been interesting......score one for me evil laugh (let's just say that I came out sorta victorious on something here) but then again I haven't gotten anything done here that I need to.....even though I specifically told a broker to fax an app to ME it went everywhere but.
46,Ok the way this day is going they're not gonna get to Adam's story until Fox Report and that's even if they do at all.
46,Ah Jayel beat me to it Adam will be on and it looks like he's taken up bullfighting.
46,Adam Housley Alert Fox News Live just mentioned that Adam Housley is going to be on.
46,Melissa - what do you mean 'nothing special' That's a cool looking house.
46,Hey girls I just woke up about 1/2 an hour ago.
46,Judging by the relatively few posts this morning we're either 1- experiencing a severe drought on the hottie front or 2-we're still recovering from the fast & furious pace of yesterday.
46,Just a couple of quick random notes- I'll have to re-read the posts & comment again later.
46,Good morning ladies Tried to log on three times yesterday and the Blogger button was missing.
46,Good Morning Ladies I thought I would get a post in before I go away.
46,A few good looking guys on TV and just look what happens to this blog.
46,Okay I'm back for one last post... Jan: Stop with the hair stuff I know your kidding and all but .... sure the shirt idea is priceless but will it work It's like I told Melissa I won't really feel good about it until I hear..a rumor on here that he wore it and wore it more than once and didn't like burn it afterwards I'll have to ask him if he still has my shirt when he gets home ... the protein is non-existant and I called the doctor about what we talked about on AIM and the receptionist/nurse had no clue what's going on Melissa: 'Helen Thomas' - Silence since this afternoon :) but we'll see what happens tomorrow... this afternoon on AIM was a blast as always I'm fresh out of stuff for tonight so I'll charge my battery and try to come up w/ something intresting for tomorrow if I see you Nat: Ugh Fruck I've got a headache again What was that you told me to do Cold compress I need to try that tomorrow Okay guys the shirt should get there (NY) tomorrow so then it's up to Fox to send it my mom was like 'Why don't you call and ask them if they've sent it.'
46,Hi Gals before I reply to some of the posts I just have to tell you I saw the strangest thing today.
46,Dang bring out the hotties & look what happens on the ol' blog :-) Well I got home just in time to see Rick for 5 seconds & hear him call Shep 'Sheppy' and hear Shep laugh.
46,Melissa: No don't be sorry Pizza sounds yummy soon I'll have it and fajitas ... Rachel Ray was on today she made bacon wrapped steaks drooling oh Ole it's Chips n Salsa again for tonight's move 'Volcano' okay my mom is in here watching made tape of 30 minute meals .. check back edit later edit Okay my mom left but not before she saw my Greg clip from this morning 'He's looking better and better.'
46,Rick was just on the Fox Report and at the beginning Shep called him Ricky and at the end Rick called him Sheppy.
46,Good Evening Everyone Melissa - I haven't gotten my picture yet.
46,here here Jen I second that I think Greg's hair looks great He seems to have pretty thick hair so I'm sure it's just his natural hairline.
46,Jayel: I don't think Greg has to do anything w/ his hair I think it's great just the way it is - besides that's how he looks can you see him any other way (as far as hair goes) I know I can't ... but you don't have to listen to me I am biased afterall...
46,Jen - What a great idea to send a shirt to Greg I think that the sage green color will look really fine on him.
46,A H: Yes there was a note attached to it.
46,AH - no no I was just joking about 'serious sir' LOL Sorry for the confusion.
46,Melissa was it really 'serious sir'
46,Jen did you send the gift to NY or Atlanta Did you send him a note with the gift
46,Ok I edited my post earlier...I thought it sounded like 'Tricky' too.
46,A H: I wish Melissa was there w/ me :) ... but let me just say that Greg is the hardest person I've shopped for ever.
46,Sherry also thought for a moment that Shep called him 'Tricky'.
46,RICK ALERT Rick was just on Studio B. I thought at the end that Shep said 'Later Ricky' but when I replayed it it sounded like he said 'Later Tricky' I couldn't quite tell maybe someone else that watched can tell.
46,Rick was just on with Shepard.
46,Melissa and Jen we'll all look out for a sage green polo type shirt with 2 buttons Did you guys decide on that color Now did Jen call NY or Atlanta branch Where did you guys get the number
46,Well AH Jen called the Fox Studio and got ahold of a guy who said it was ok for her to send the shirt.
46,Jen and Melissa tell us more about the shirt idea.
46,Wow guys a lot of posts today - I need to read them later... Nat: That e-mail was the greatest :) Happy dancing around the house for you A H: I figured that's what the question is about So I am melting I just ate chips and salsa :) heaven ... went to the gym today and took a pilates class - a lot of fun - I ran into Frank the Trainer today he wasn't yelling at the girl he was training intresting Okay chatting w/ Melissa - I still need her to hold my hand through this whole shirt thing .. check back later
46,Hi all Quite a news day on Fox I'm just typing this and don't know if anyone has posted this already but I just wanted to let all know the latest Fox favorites sightings.
46,OH Nat - you poor poor thing....the hotties are in today.
46,Wow the blog is happening today.
46,OK- I told ya'll that I replied earlier- so here's his reply: 'went out today.'
46,OMG - HOW MANY Greg's could FOX possibly have hired There's a new Greg I've never seen named Greg Burke reporting from Rome at the moment...well at least the anchors don't have to learn new names.
46,Hottie Alert: In addition to Rick being on this morning Adam Housley has also been on talking about the Ca.
46,Dangit I knew I should have set the VCR.....again I thought about it and thought nah won't happen.
46,YES My 'Rick Sense' is very heightened today I was watcing TV and all the sudden I was like 'I need to switch it to Fox' so I did and Mr. Leventhal was on at that VERY SECOND I have NO IDEA what he was reporting on though LOL....I was too busy trying to grab my camera in time.
46,RICK ALERT He was just on (7:30am PDT) reporting a story regarding a story written by a reporter that was radically changed by Rueters.
46,Hey everyone Thought I'd do a quick postie before I uh....well start work.
46,Good Morning Ladies Well just woke up and turned on my tv and there is Adam.
46,Jan - I did see Perioa on tv today.
46,Nat: It was strange for me to see him that car too Esp.
46,OK- gotta catch up Sherry- Going to shows for you is about the same for me- we're about half hour 45 min.
46,Ok so I post that last one and now my screen is a split screen again....what is going on Is it me Sherry while I too am somewhat saddened by the death of Bob Hope I am also getting a little tired of it.
46,Hi Gals I signed on to blogger yesterday and today to find it totally different for me I never understood what you were talking about when some of you would say you didn't have the split screen now I know and I don't like it one bit.
46,Okay this post is a little abstract but I'm tryin' to kill sometime before I can drink some liquids...
46,Cable News Ratings for Friday 7/25: O'Reilly: 1.6 Hannity & Colmes: 1.4 Greta: 1.3 Shep: 1.2 Brit: 1.1 Larry King: .8 Aaron Brown: .5 Paula Zahn: .4 Hardball: .4 I believe that both O'Reilly and Shep were off last Friday so it's interesting that Fox Report had ratings that were almost as high as Greta's in addition to Fox Report not being in as favorable a time slot as Greta's show.
46,Leslie - I'm so sorry that you've had such a bad week but very relieved that the lump was non-malignant.
46,Hey gals Well somehow my lunch hour flew by & I didn't get a chance to post.
46,Leslie - What a week you had you poor girl.
46,Afternoon everyone Didn't have to yell at Melrose yet but the show isn't over - did catch that one ER where Lucy died - that was sad made me cry :( Leslie: Soo ooo glad everything went okay with you this morning I got your e-mail..thanks for letting me know everything is okay ... oh I can't wait to see you AIM to tell you all about the insanity which was shirt shopping A H: So what was this mysterious question that made him embarassed You've got me curious ...
46,I just thought I'd pop in for a sec....I'll respond more later.
46,Nat/Sherry - Just like you we're in that same tax bracket.
46,Hey Ladies I'm Baa-ack Thank you so much for your concern about my untimely disappearance but last week was hell.
46,Nat - OMG - We are so much alike it is crazy.
46,Hey all I was going to post last night after I copied some stuff on to CD but I was having so much trouble (had to reboot-like hard reboot- at least seven times within a half hour or so) that I just wanted to put the dang thing away.
46,emerges from a deep summer nap Evening everyone Sherry: I got your last message you sent me - hopefully yes it will pass its just this weekend did not go how I wanted it to (i.e.
46,Hi Everyone This weekend has been very relaxing.
46,Sherry: No I wouldn't laugh at you going to the American Idol tour - in fact I have to admit I'm a bit jealous - I promised myself never to look at American Idol and then I saw the first episode of the 2nd season and well shaking my head It was the only show I would actually change the channel off of Greg to look at Melissa: Enjoy Tomb Raider 2 I've wanted to see that - well I've wanted to see a lot of summer movies but the movie theater has to many good smells for me to go ... nerves aside I've been rather sleepy today so I've been taking long summer naps today Jan: I wasn't able to get my protein bars in (more on this later) so I'm kinda really scared now as to what I can take because I need to take something so maybe I can function after 1:00 p.m. because I am just about flatlined after then - I did eat another hot dog and a full deviled egg today for my meals - tomorrow meatballs well at least 1 So I went to try my protein bars and I couldn't tell which was worse - protein bars or protein 'juice' uhh shuddering Mr. Oompa is still here in fact I think he might take up full-time residence w/ me - I wish he could find some other gastric patient to visit but he seems to be content w/ me :( How many of you guys saw Greg today It seems that the US is very close to nabbing Saddam - Melissa: I saw this and I was like..well I thought it was ironic...
46,Hello Everyon I'm finally getting around to posting.
46,Hi Gals I actually caught the report by Rick on Fox Report.
46,Sherry - I was in another room and not paying any particular attention to Fox Report when I heard Rick's voice.
46,Rick was on Fox Report And he was wearing JEANS and a long-sleeved shirt opened at the neck.
46,Hi Gals My name is Jan and I am a total sloth I have done nothing this weekend except sleep watch tv and eat Here comes the excuses----I am at my parent's house watching their dogs while they are on a long weekend to Iowa.
46,Good Morning It is so quiet here the last couple days.
46,Looks like most of us LevenGals are MIA.
46,Holy cow....where is everyone I checked in here last night & was too wiped out to type.....so here I am at 5:30 Sat.
46,Wow it is quiet in here tonight.
46,Hi Ladies Decided to start my Labor Day weekend early by taking the afternoon off.
46,Hey gals It's a gray and raining Friday morning girls are in school and I'm fighting the urge to go back to bed.
46,Good Morning Ladies I dont know if anyone saw Adam this morning at his 8:45 report but he was looking really good.
46,Well I'm finally getting around to posting.
46,Hi ladies Isn't it great to have Rick and Shep back We may be able to see quite a bit of Rick with the second anniversary of 9-11 coming up.
46,So help me....if this Bustamante gets elected I'm electing early retirement to TX.
46,Hey guys this may seem like a silly question but do they ever show CNN commercials when you're watching FOX I just saw one and then I KNOW I saw one last week as well.
46,Hey Gals Well I went a record 3.5 hours with my hard lenses in last night.
46,Rick Alert Rick has been on this morning talking about 9-11 tapes that are going to be released today.
46,Leslie - So glad to hear Sarah is doing so well on the new medication.
46,Guys thank you so much for the love support and group hugs.
46,Hi Gals I was supposed to go to a baseball game tonight but with the heat index in the 100's I think I'll spend the evening with you and the a/c.
46,Hey gals I think I'm still in the same mode as yesterday- sleepy but gettin' through some crappy stuff (stuff I've been dreading doing here at work).
46,Leslie - I hope that all is well with your little one.
46,Good Morning Ladies I don't have much time.
46,A quick post before I go home- I'll get as far as I can and then pick up where I left off tomorrow.
46,Hey ladies I'm almost back to my fiesty self this week.
46,Nice to be back with the LevenGals again.
46,Good Afternoon Ladies Well I'm feeling better today.
46,I've had some strange dreams so I thought I'd post them before I post my main post.
46,Another day another..... well I guess we can fill in the blank LOL Our power went out again last night for about 20 minutes.
46,Wow Just now watching Fox & Friends and Greg Palkot actually chuckled and smiled at a comment from Brian.
46,Melissa - Thanks for posting Rick's e-mail.
46,Well look at that something drastic has happened... OMG I can not believe Greg is at the Pentagon this week - do you know that's less than or just at 30 minutes away from me I was thinking about that as I was driving to dinner omg omg omg I'm freaking out ooo I'm so close to Greg Kelly it's scary...My friend Amanda is like 'You should go see him' I'm like 'no way' I mean like he should know how close he is to me he could at least stop by - I won't be here but he could wait at my doorstep but the truth is that I could get into the Pentagon and walk past Greg Kelly with a huge sign on me that says 'Greg Kelly: I sent you a shirt' and he wouldn't even reconize me :( that is so sad... so AH no news on the shirt my friend Amanda has 3 theories on the shirt: 1) The shirt scared him off the air 2) Some smoe at Fox News is prancin' around in it or 3) The guy at the post office is prancin' around in it ...
46,Hey~ Decided to catch up now instead of tomorrow morning....then I'm going to eat & hit the sack.
46,Hey gals- just a quick post before I have to start into work again.
46,Hi guys Melissa thanks for the interesting news So cool that Rick wrote to you twice and on top of all that news about Greg K Wow so Greg K is doing his Marine Reserve duty at the Pentagon What kind of work Jen any updates on the Greg shirt thing Hope your school stuff is going great
46,Oh this day is getting better Adam is on He hasn't been on all day and now it's like bam he's on.
46,OH lookie Jen -- I guess I should be careful what I ask for.
46,weakly climbs the steps up to the computer Hey everyone - my semester trademark AIM message of 'Consider me dead' is gone so that means I'm back from school - somewhat alive...
46,Hi LevenGals Hope everyone had a great weekend Mine was pretty good - oldest son Brendon came home for the day Friday.
46,Hey girlies Everyone must be having a busy weekend It's going to be a hot one here today- it's already 82 outside (75 inside) and barely a breeze.
46,Hi Gals Wow it's been getting slower and slower in here lately...hopefully Shep will be back Monday and we will have more sightings of 'our' guys.
46,Hello Hope everyone is having a great weekend.
46,Hey gals We had a little 'excitement' last night.
46,Hi Gals Jen I would totally go to Oxford if I had the chance.
46,Hey gals Time to catch up I was only gone for about an hour this morning- boy did I ever luck out.
46,ROFLMAO @ Rick F. right now Did you all catch that 'Just & Kelly' joke they played on him Even my dad was crakin' up I'll be back in a little bit gotta head off to dinner.
46,Jen - I hope that all of your school plans work out for you.
46,Well just getting around to posting.
46,Good morning Ladies Home from work today - we're getting new computer servers at the office so - no computers - no work - on a Friday no less.
46,I haven't had a chance to read any of the posts this morning sof I'm sorry if I'm being repetitive.
46,It's a Todd kind of day : ) Yeah I'm home- I ended up getting called in for jury duty which is good- I need a break from the drama at work.
46,Nan: I am so sorry to hear about your father - cancer is a very scary thing and it runs so heavily in my family I know what you're going through.
46,Leslie - Glad to hear everything went okay and you're on your way to recovery.
46,Hey Guys Been a long time since I posted on here..been thinking of what to say but drawing a big huge blank.
46,Hi Gals- Sherry I got the email but like Natalie's I can't open it.
46,Hey gals Thanks so much for the happy thoughts.
46,Sherry- Ah yeah....black & white photos do have that grainy quality in the paper.
46,Nat- I looked at that photo and it is not the same one.

48,ok so yesterday i watched the tape of crouching tiger/hidden dragon that andrew brought home from the library.
48,ok so i cheated for the second day in a row- i looked up the tour results but now i can't wait to see the video because i want to see how lance pulled off a stage win and the maillot jaune all in the same race.and how another postal rider is now third in the tour.
48,ok so i have cheated and i already feel guilty about it.

48,ok so mean mamma just wants to say.....thanks...to acw and scw for all of those years that i did not have to monitor your homework progress worry about spelling words or math drills or spend 45 minutes cajoling either one of you to write more than 1 sentence on what labor day means to you that did not come straight out of the dictionary........ tonight i have spent the last 2 hours working through the spelling word thing- trying to get from 'i already know my words' to 'i don't want to do the words' to 'i will never have to know these words ' to numerous time outs an almost missed supper and finally an effeciently spent 10 minutes actually writing down words that mean mamma said aloud (yes aloud was a word tonight as well as allowed as in cayle is not allowed to drive a car....) so frustrating when your daughter cannot be just like your sons....again guys thanks so very much........

48,ok so i should have seen this coming- andrew at the age of two once refused the offer of a parental hand while crossing the street- instead he clasped his own hand- saying 'i hold my own hand....' he has been a 'hold-my-own-hand kind of guy all along so i cannot be too surprised that he left for college with such minimal fanfare- no tearful goodbyes no hugs no promises to call...honestly- i wouldn't be surprised if he never really moves back home.

48,ok so anne williams is my new hero(ine)- she called dhs today to complain about ms bennet and her religious agenda- running the prince of egypt at the 10th grade level is a sign that things have gotten out of hand.....now if she had invited a muslim to come and speak on islam and a jew to come and speak about judiaism i wouldn't be so upset.
48,ok so today is wednesday and wednesday is the day that my friend gail and i play the lottery- i call her my millionaire friend by the way because i am convinced that we will win one day.

48,ok so at my class last night i looked down to check off names from the roster of students- and i cannot focus on the paper- i can barely make out the letters- and in order to not look totally incompetent to new students i blunder on for a few names until i just whip off the glasses to see if they are just smudged (which would be better than me going blind in a matter of minutes....) i wiped them off and then noticed to my horror that they were NOT MY GLASSES.
48,ok so i entertain myself while cooking by imagining trip scenarios.

48,ok so a former nutrition education intern stopped by yesterday.
48,ok so today the client i saw in a doctor's office after work was born within 5 days of me- in 1956. i find these things fascinating- i have met at least 5 people born the same day (february 25) and have actually met someone born the same day and year (she was having her 8th baby on welfare and looked about 10 years older than i felt at the time........) yet and still meeting people very near to your own exact age is intriguing- this guy had a new baby with his girlfriend (his oldest child is 24) whoa- i cannot imagine getting up and changing diapers at my age.
48,ok so the c-w's are back on the big screen....big computer screen that is.
48,ok so my eku class starts 1 week from tonight at 6:00- i have 30 students- most are nursing students and none that i know personally at least from the roster i downloaded yesterday.

48,ok so the salmon with cucumber sauce went quickly as did the three-color tomato and cucumber salad.
48,ok so it is friday and that means that i won't get home til at least 10 tonight- we have 47 reservations for people wanting our dinner/playhouse combo which tonight is murder at the vicarage.
48,OK SO stephan and i heard a mortefying piece on npr on the way home from work today- it was about how the drug companies used propaganda to promote menopausal hormone use - since the 50's.........the one spot we heard was an older woman who said that she took hormone pills because she feared that her husband would leave her for an younger woman if she didn't.......i was so appalled that i almost wrecked the car- of course- the woman in the spot was complaining of her symptoms- hot flashes lack of shortterm memory and meannness.........but the part about her fears of her husband leaving her really upset me- this woman sounded like she lived only for her husband to come home from work- that was her first mistake....... she sounded very republican in that regard.... why didn't she have a life of her own for gracious sakes.
48,ok so i have always suspected that clients whitewash their personal accounts of foods eaten at any given meal to make their weight problem seem less like their fault.
48,okay so i fear that my blog about dewey dell in as i lay dying was interpreted as an anti-abortion crack on my part and i apologize for the confusion and misunderstanding.

48,ok so i listened to part of becks' new album on-line and it reminds me of a james bond soundtrack..............
48,ok so i cannot find my paperback copy of tender is the night by fscottfitzgerald- it is so annoying to have books that cannot be located.
48,ok so i almost blogged on stephan's blog because he failed to sign out before getting up from the computer but then that would be mean and even mean mamma has her standards.............................. i overheard a workmate yesterday talking about her name with another co-worker- she cited her last name as her slave name- and noted that she didn't know what her real family name was- that her family had taken the name of the master long ago and kept it.
48,ok so i was going to report on the alumni game but decided against it.
48,ok so our computer monitor has bit the dust so i am forced to hook up our laptop to the modem to access the internet.
48,ok so i surfed a bit this afternoon to relax and found an offensive site called curmudgeonry or something liek that- for people who have many gripes and need to be heard- i may be mean but i try very hard not to be banal when it comes to my griping- the first gripe was about britney spears- who is not even on my radar screen when it comes to sounding off- so much for 'reading around'.
48,ok so i continue with travel fantasies- i would rather take the first trip scenario- the one that involved a rental car and a flight to barcelona with a loop through the dordogne bordeaux and bilbao.
48,ok so i stand corrected on this sophomore/world civ thing- ryan montgomery assured me this very evening that as of this week he is teaching american studies with jan scott now that miss sanders has moved on to a job in frankfort.
48,ok so i am assigning a reading list prior to this trip- i would appreciate that all of my fellow traveler's read hemingway's the sun also rises- it is set in both paris and spain- st. sebastian and pamplona- since i was in paris with each of the intended voyagers and will travel to these places with them as well- it makes reading the book essential.....it takes place about the time of the civil war.. certainly no quiz involved- but an intelligent discussion of major themes would be greatly rewarded.......now that we have a car we can visit the town of guernica in preparation for seeing the painting....from reading my guide books- lonely planet rick steves and dk eyewitness- i beilieve that i may have to go into major alcoholconsumption training prior to this trip- it seems that drinking is all that is done in the towns that we intend to visit.
48,ok so i reserved a car for pickup on the 5th if january and drop off late on the 8th of january.
48,ok so this morning in church 2 women sitting in front of me had visible panty lines- really tacky- the younger one's skirt came down so low when she sat down i could see that her underwear was turquoise....mean mamma mentions this because visible underwear are (is) one of her pet peeves....be they boxers or briefs or thongs- i should not have to glare at them....
48,ok so my partner and i fed over 450 people today from lunch through midnight break and we are tired.
42,I introduce to you ... the Trikke What is a Trikke you ask If you haven't heard of or seen one up until now you will see more of them soon.

42,The dishonesty and deceit going on in the political arena today is beyond belief.
42,The left has been kicking up a fuss about President Bush’s regular references to God.It makes no sense.Every time I turn on the TV it seems that I’m hearing some Hollywood pneumacranium saying “Oh my G_d” “God D__n” or “J____S C____t”.

44,Blogging is mainly for keeping a record rather than to entertain though if the record can be kept entertaining it helps.

44,Well I haven't posted all week as nothing happened.
44,Well come rain or shine I should write this blog whether there's something interesting happening or not.
44,It's quite unusual for me to have a busy week nowadays partly from avoiding them and partly from little to do worth getting out of the house for.

42,Here are a few pictures of my flea market booth from a few weeks back.
42,I've been busy doing research and trying to find more wholesale sources.
42,Hey all I've been busy and lazy since my last post.
44,While eating breakfast at Denny's I found myself watching an old timer eating by himself.
44,Dad I hardly knew you You were just a dream to me Someone that I heard about But who I had rarely seen I kept your picture in my dresser drawer I kept your memory in my heart Now the memories have begun to fade The years have torn them apart I have seen so many places I have felt so much sorrow Dad why weren’t you ever here To reassure me about tomorrow The first time I fell in love I could have used some fatherly advice And when she finally broke my heart Some comfort would have been nice I spent so many lonely days In my room without a friend If only you had been around Instead of a memory on the wind We could have seen so many places We could have shared so many things You could have given me your wisdom And the comfort a father brings Now today I received a phone call From a very good friend of yours He told me you had passed away For you cancer there was no cure But the saddest thing he said to me Was that he had never known That you had left three young children Behind in a broken home Now his news has torn me up inside There is so much I would have said Now I would give anything If we had had just one more day I would have told you all about my life My hopes my dreams my fears But most of all I would have said to you I loved you dad Oh how much I loved you D.S.
44,Last Tuesday I began what I thought would be a simple process.
44,Colored in vibrant gold and reds the leaf remains in place on its branch.

44,Apparently all of the worlds problems have been solved.
44,I sit and I watch The stars at night I think of what's wrong I think of what's right A war torn country A terrible sight Children who run From the dark to the light My heart is heavy With insignificant pain But what I feel Just isn't the same My problems are few Compared to theirs Someday it just seems Like it's so hard to care As I sit in the park On a merry go round Placed there for children To spin round and round I want to cry But I can't find the tears I want to run But the pain is always near To some love is the answer A light at darkest noon To me love is a fear That never leaves to soon Some can't understand That emotions are real Not something tarnished Made from recycled steel I want to run Into the arms of a friend I want to hide Until time begins to bend I want to capture the moonlight Dancing on the waves I want to walk thru the sand A moment to save I want to live without questions No soiled explanations Talk to whom I please Without emotional citations I want to live in solitude Lost in a fantasy I want to sleep in the rain And escape reality I want to be a boy again No pressure to bear Playing with soldiers Dirt in my hair Riding a merry go round Singing a song Watching the moonlight And crying… Alone

44,Since I've been printing your comments for him to read your daddy occasionally comes up with clever and humourous remarks that he tells me to 'tell them' which means on the blog.
44,We took Kristen to a Neurologist today where she got a standard set of 'raise this hand walk on your toes how may fingers am I holding up' tests which didn't indicate any problems.
44,Same place as the first one - between the end of the love seat and the wall to the downstairs bedroom.
44,At the time you officially became my Daddy the occupant of the White House was from Texas and he was busy shipping teenage kids to a hostile environment in order to prevent the hostile environment´s spread.
44,Kristen had a seizure this morning but is OK now.
44,This doesn't solve all of the update problems because it still doesn't email you when we have updates but if you're tracking more than one blog there are ways to keep track of which ones have new posts in them.

42,One of the biggest concerns facing us today is jobs.
42,The purpose of this blog is to create a forum for people to tell the Austin County Democratic Party and Austin County Democrats Club how they feel.
42,'I have no problems with that issue [same-sex marriage] at all.
42,I'm sure we're all absorbed in the Democratic National Convention but I wanted to share an observation about the whole 'e-voting' issue.
42,Wow I've been glued to MSNBC tonight.
42,Does anyone out there remember Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address I know I sure do...
42,A passage from Bob Woodward's recent book quotes Bush as saying 'I do not need to explain why I say things.
42,Check in again for my diatribe on Shrub and his miserable AIDS policy.
42,OK so whether you're in favor or opposed to this whole notion of 'gay marriage' the Republican arm of our government (not just the Congress but I'll include our Pretender-In-Chief in this too) are now pissing and moaning about the 'radical justices' overstepping their bounds.
42,Reminds me of the old folk song 'For every season TURN TURN TURN'...
42,I don't know the original source of this but would be glad to give them 'props' if anyone out there does know... Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a 'we can't find Bin Laden' diversion.
42,Finally Ron tells it like it is I'm not sure if he was shackled by the 'keep it positive' mantra of the Democratic Party but this is certainly a more comprehensive analysis of the Bush regime...
44,From the Chicago Tribune: Harkin Calls Cheney's Words and Actions 'Cowardly' August 17 2004 DES MOINES -- Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa pushed the name-calling in the presidential race to a new level Monday calling Vice President Dick Cheney a coward for not serving in Vietnam and cowardly for his criticism of John Kerry.
44,Time to time I will find good candidates whose positions I agree with and find conducive to our society.
44,Yesterday I watched President Bush lean on a podium cock his eyebrow the way he does and ask Senator John Kerry if he would have gone to war knowing then what he knows today.
44,One reason columnists and comedians will be sad to see President Bush go is because of the loss of actual quotes to write and joke about.
44,I can't think of a better way to initiate my blog than by posting the exchange President Bush had with an American Indian reporter at a conference for minority journalists.
47,I am back to work today and busy cleaning up crap from the weeks before.
47,My website provides me with a sharing space for friends and family.

42,We need a plan of attack for our research project.
42,OK I'm not quite up to a plan yet....but I do have some ideas for themes.
42,Mary G. asked about outcomes of usage in the survey.
42,Reviewing results from interesting bits of relevant research -- like MaryG's summary of the Chen paper -- is useful to our thinking.
42,Original Message-----From: Marye W. Subject: Senior Paper -- some ideas April 6 email I was looking over the paper -- Here is an abbreviated story (we can split up some of these themes to investigate once we have a story): Starts with Lifelong learning (or openness to experience or curiosity) leads to an interest in cultural currency (you know I think we could draw on some literature on 'memes' perhaps -- we could spend some time really trying to understand the concept of cultural currency) + Add a desire for cultural currency to the layers of self efficacy -- particularly technological self-efficacy (maybe strongly related to attitudes towards technology right) and internet self-efficacy (maybe general self-efficacy we'll see).
42,I think those seniors who are creative or recognize the creative potential in them Internet are more likely to adopt.
42,I was also surprised to see that Rogers mentions that self-efficacy predicts early adoption.
42,Epiphany Part 2 MW and I had an IM date this morning.
42,A million years ago we talked about studying online senior communities.
42,For the small group of people who say they haven't adopted 'because they just haven't gotten around to it yet' (I think 35 or so) the only variable that is significant in separating them from people who don't seem to be at all interested is -- curiosity .
42,A series of items on our questionnaire involve attitudes about the internet (helps me stay more culturally current more in touch with my family I want to learn more about the internet) have a high Cronbach's alpha (.81) and can be summed together.
42,OK -- I've been doing some runs this morning.
42,From a 2002 JBR authored by Fareena Sultan based on longitudinal panel data collected by a research firm and collected between 2Q95 (when 21.7% of the sample had adopted to 2Q99 (when 66.1 percent of the sample had adopted the internet): Early adopters were more innovative (on a 4 item psychographic measure) than later adopters Early adopters were more likely to consider tech items to be fun Early adopters were more affluent Early adopters are more aware of new technologies The amount of money spent on ISP was positively related to innovativeness
42,The following points come from a relatively interesting and well-done study published in JM by Steenkamp Hofstede and Wedel (1999) 'A Cross-National Investigation into the Individual and National Cultural Antecedents of Consumer Innovativeness.'
42,In an interview in 2001 Everett Rogers mentions that one of the puzzles in innovation and diffusion research is why someone who adopts an innovation is willing and often very eager to tell other people about it especially in a competitive environment.
42,This is from a Baumgartner and Stennkamp International Journal of Research in Marketing (1996) 'Exploratory Consumer Buying Behavior: Conceptualization and Measurement.'
42,MG and I met in Boston (we missed you) and had a few epiphanies that I thought I’d try out on you: We are not dealing with opinion leadership b/c it is not product category specific nor product specific nor brand specific.
42,Social integration is part of what makes it more likely an innovation will be adopted -- we have this (I think) coded in our data as 'life involvement/openness to learning.'
42,What I learned from Midgley and Dowling's 1978 'Innovativeness: The concept and its measurement' One can write a lot of pages explaining a really simple idea.
42,In the file of I can't believe JCR published this: Dickerson and Gentry learned that low origance (translation: un-artsy) high intellectance (intelligence) folks were more likely to be early adopters of computers.
42,In my reading on adoption and diffusion I've run across a citation of two papers by Hirschman on Consumer Creativity.
42,In looking at the market maven lit I'm not sure how relevant it is to our study.
42,Odds refer to a ratio of probabilities while odds ratios refer to ratios of odds.

42,Sigh...why do some ppl have to be so hardheaded and stubborn that they just blow things out of porportion and then give up when it gets hard in relationships..I am trying to help someone and all they want to fixate on is the bad (or the perceived bad) and then proceed to replay the same mistakes as in other relationships..I try to help and all I do is stress and make myself ill and frustrated...And feeling the twinges of crazy lady is just making me feel like i want to crawl away into the dark and stay there..I would rather crawl into some warm friendly arms but too far away...sigh...I am trying to breathe but not working too well as the knots in my throat and stomach are forcing all my energy out...I know there is nothing I can do to help other than to be there..its just.....sigh....almost time for lunch...maybe sitting in the trees outside can help...maybe to cry would help..not sure as this feels like one of those times where if i start i may not be able to stop....hmmmm...more later...
42,Well it may have happened..crazy lady may be here a little....After last post I started to feel anxious and I knew I had been calm not long before..I started the breathing..works for few sec only tho...trying hard to stay focused and calm...50 50 battle going on but I am not freaking out this time..so one good step...trying to breath...ok getting better..knot in stomach gone...ok...calm is lasting longer...yes its helping but the i still have the anxiety below the surface like little bubbles...maybe a good fart would work..lolol...ok sigh...ok time for bed....good thoughts and nice images in my mind...helps...breathing...ok..nite:):)
42,HI Well first I have to apologize as I was not thinking on the same time frame that you were when we were talking about classes.
42,WEll morning...delayed in entering my blog this morning as there seems to be a steady stream of stuff for me to do..Its like everyone in the office is trying to keep me busy..too funny...I have been proof reading documents reworking old files to excel as well as my faxing in and out and doing mail...not too bad really just steady..I have caught myself not breathing right so I change my pattern and I feel calm...Helps with my stress I can see that affect right now...I am noticing some of my triggers too...one is a person here at NCSU who is sweet but when she come up to me she is so intense it spills over...So I caught myself in the bad habit and moved to the better one..This process is eye opening and interesting....no answer yet from my uncle on the website..I thought I would hear something by now as I want to get started as they want the site up by end of July for live viewing...Matthew cut all his hair short and he looks soo good...It actually caught me off guard but I very much like it and it takes years off for him....I think he like how surprised I was.
42,Oh my oh my..what a nice weekend....Sigh..It has put a nice smile on my face and a content calm feeling in my heart.
42,Ok..what is the deal with time slowing down the last 2 hours on a friday afternoon when I want to go home especially to day as I have several errands to do so I can go out of town..This morning flew by and was hectic and now since 2p its like a slowwwww drag...I just don't understand this....Plus why don't ppl get a clue that you are not going to get any business done on a friday afternoon..This office starts to clear out at 3p so why get huffy with me...Its funny how the ppl who call think I can magically fix things if the buyer is not here...Please...I would touch those questions unless I was making the money they do...well time for errands....:):)
42,No real tangent this morning..Back bothering me a little...I hate being old to the point i have to stretch so much to get going in the morning...I feel creaky..just like another person I know who likes to say he is creaky...lol...yeah my new shoes just arrived..I have new birkies...very comfy too..well almost time to go the lunch thing...cant wait to break in my shoes...later
42,Ok....Its been a freaking day..actually a freaking cranky ass week...Dang what is up with everything and everyone being so damm cranky and ill especially today...first the toner goes out and the fax machine breaks so that when I ask to callt o get it fixed I was YELLED at why I didn't doit sooner..I then reminded this person I was told to wait as long as I could to fix and replace the supplies as the fiscal year is getting ready to end....then I got a apology but my stress level has been so damm high all day cause of this...then the fax guy tells me the machine need to be taken to the shop and he will bring a loaner in the morning...which is fine as it is a slow fax day but everyone in the office is freaking out like oh my god we can't live if the fax machine is out..Then I am not a bookeeper but they have me doing the reconcilations which of course we dont have invoices for half the stuff..Been driving me crazy too...I think half of this office is PMSing all at the same time...good thing we dont ahve any shot guns or they might get used..lololol....Then chris is blowing issues with his friend out of porportion so I have had to have several long talks with him to day to help him see things clearer...I think I helped but he is such a doomsayer sometimes...I try to tell him my mantra of live in the moment but I don't think he hears me when he listens sometimes....ok now I got to go to WTCC and I am so not in the mood but you gotta do what ya gotta do...sigh....I am soooooooooooooooooooo glad I am leaving town for the weekend...even if all I do is a whole lot of nothing then that would be awesome...I didn't say a whole lot of boring cause going out of town is NEVER boring just real real NICE..:):):):):) Well what would life be without a few bumps in the road.....small really little ones pleases...:):)
42,Ok I am such a stupid ass sometimes.
42,Well the doctors office called with my blood test results...My thryoid levels are normal which is good as that could aggravate my hormone levels.. My cholesterol is really good at 174..I am stoked on that as the men in my family are having issues with high cholesterol and heart disease.
42,Yawn....Its this time of day that I would dearly love to take a nap...Trying to start the day off good.
42,Well went to the doctor this morning.
42,Sigh...am I doing too much working 2 jobs..I like the money but this place (NCSU) is getting as bad as WTCC with the politics and BS..I usually enjoy being here cause I can be a social butterfly but when I feel more annoyed than anything then is it time to go...I want to be able to concentrate on being a artist somehow..I want to be able to enjoy life and not feel like I need a nap at the end of a day...BUT if I go back to one job (WTCC) then I am afraid of being a sloth who slept all day before Feb....I want to do more webwork...Especially the advice column...What keeps me so afraid of leaping sometimes..I am envious of what JB is doing even tho he is very busy..It seems he is not afraid to try..why can't I..Not feeling sad just more questioning....Also worried over going to the doctor..some of it is what they will tell me and that i will get scolded..I know I haven't been the greatest about taking care of myself...but I have more incentive now..mainly for me..losing another 1/2 inch to my hips is a nice incentive..I can actually fit into a 2x now..which means in the last 3 years I have gone from a high 4x to a low 2x which is actually is 5 dress sizes...I actually bought a slinky outfit for the first time in 15 years as a treat to myself instead of rewarding with food..am proud of myself...plus I think I look good in my red/fuscia slinky outfit...heeheehee....Making efforts to eat better is helping me I can tell...when I relapse and eat alot of carbs I feel bad and that feeling lasts in my mind so I can have some incentive not to next time...Adding soy to my diet too but still can't enjoy the taste as is but good if I add to tea...gonna try to find other ways to eay more soy but its hard....sigh....just need more exercise....hard when my back hurts...need to go to a chiro but I am so mistrustful when it comes to my back....except for one person who rubs my back until I literally purr...mmmmmmmmmmm..closing my eyes and thinking of that just now is helping me relax...mmmmmmmmmmm...there are times when a hug even a quick one makes it all better.. :):):)

44,This is just another story of a glitch walked into the room and the system was down no screen just system running checked everything shut it off finally pushed the start button and well it booted up like there wasn't a thing wrong and when my wife came home she said she was having problems with work computer today also it was the day of system glitches.
44,Well you know how it goes no two people like there food cooked the same way.
44,It seems that when you schedule a scan disc for drive c zone alarm keeps the windows system from doing the scan and the fix for this glitch's to uninstall zone alarm so as to give windows complete control over drive C. Your other drives if you have them are not affected by this glitch.
44,This is a story of a family who purchases a boat.
44,Maybe the jet stream has a glitch in It because its pretty cool around here for this time of the year just had to report this one offer the record.

42,'The Age Melbourne’s oldest newspaper turns 150 on October 17 this year.
42,In its debut edition (July 20 1889) the Dead Bird didn't just publish what some believe was the first half-tone photo in an Aussie newspaper it published the first nude photo - a back view of West Indies-born boxing champion Peter Jackson.
42,I have a lot of material on 'why modular layout is a wonderful thing' but have been searching high and low for practical info on why irregular layout (nested doglegs and so on) was a popular look in newspapers around the world after WWII.
42,Plodding away on the timeline while I await the arrival of new books.
42,Had my first encounter with that wily beast known as the microfiche.
42,I'd be up the creek without a paddle if I didn't at least give them a mention here... My parents are also interested in history and design.
42,Rupert Murdoch had to utter the famous line on the first night of printing when he launched Australia's new national daily The Australian on July 15 1964... and it was all due to a single incorrect number on the front page masthead.
42,The Australian press hit back at war-time censorship in April 1944.
42,Okay so it was a bit ambitious to suggest I'd have the timeline up already.
42,I hope to post my timeline of Australian newspapers here by the end of the week.
42,I am merging several media timelines.
42,I am researching the history of newspaper design in Australia.
42,Well the moving's done; I can get back to work as soon as I work out which box my stuff's in... got an email today telling me a book I ordered months ago is finally on its way - The Form of News A History by Kevin G. Barnhurst and John Nerone New York: The Guilford Press April 2001.
42,Someone reminded me this morning about Sir Larry Lamb the British editor who introduced the Page 3 girl to the London Sun.
42,The Australian turns 40 on Thursday and its commemmorative stuff is going to be a huge help to me.
42,Research on newspapers has taken a temporary back seat to research on real estate.
42,This week I've had a great chat with Guy Morrison who designed The Australian in 1964.
42,This is the broadsheet version of the Daily Telegraph August 1 1927.
42,I've just found a reference that says the Dead Bird was not the first Australian newspaper to publish a half-tone photo.
42,My little 'vacation' from research will be over in a few days .
47,Y'know that HUGE deficit we have now Y'know that the war on terror isn't actually accounted for in Bush's budget plans right Well the administration is already planning to slash domestic spending in '06 as a way to 'control spending' says the Washington Post : 2006 Cuts In Domestic Spending On Table By Jonathan Weisman Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday May 27 2004; Page A01 The White House put government agencies on notice this month that if President Bush is reelected his budget for 2006 may include spending cuts for virtually all agencies in charge of domestic programs including education homeland security and others that the president backed in this campaign year.'
47,Pleasant Poll Particular: Salon.com is reporting that the key swing state of Pennsylvania is turning BLUE: 'May 27 2004 | HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) -- John Kerry has erased President Bush's lead in the swing state of Pennsylvania according to a poll that found growing opposition to the war in Iraq.
47,Well the reaction to the 'big' speech Not so good.
47,I missed his appearance on 60 Minutes last night - my 20 month old daughter was attempting to use the potty - but what this retired general who used to run Central Command (meaning that he was in charge of ALL troops in the Middle East) had to say about the course of the war - you know the course we're supposed to 'stay' - is alarming to say the least: From the transcript: “There has been poor strategic thinking in this” says Zinni.
47,Just read this in the Hollywood Reporter - Looks like the Big 4 networks have caught on to the fact that this is SPIN not NEWS: Big Four to pass on Bush speech The broadcast networks are not expected to carry President Bush's primetime speech tonight in which he will lay out a 'clear strategy' for the future of Iraq.
47,Great news that Moore's latest documentary 'Fahrenheit 911' has won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.
47,Our illustrious prez will be addressing us all tonight to reassure us that he has Iraq under control.
47,Details are scanty but I got a call today about a top-secret book coming soon that documents the fact the government's been secretly (of course) experimenting on US soldiers for some time now.
47,I can't say enough about how good (and comforting for those of us on the left) this brand-new radio network is.
47,It's hard not to think that this is going to (thankfully) cost Mr. Bush his re-election.
47,I got tired of reading everyone else's so I figured I'd start my own How 21st Century of me Hope I don't bore you to death as I ramble on about: - the current state of US politics (hint: Vote Kerry) - my fun job as a buyer for B&N.com - my wonderful family - media stuff I enjoy and want to point out to YOU - the Mets (yes they're pretty sucky right now but still...) Hope you enjoy reading as much as (I hope) I'm going to enjoy writing it Nicholas
47,Took a long lunch today and finally saw the film.
47,And you know darn well what 'it' is.
47,Was lucky enough to get an autographed copy in the mail today from Random House - now I can display it at home next to my signed Hillary (Neither is personalized sadly.)
47,I have to say that I came away from the screening a little disappointed.
47,I'm not JUST all about Politics - although my lovely wife might disagree with that self-assessment.
47,An ABC News poll tells the story of Bush's dwindling poll numbers on the key issues of the Iraq war and fighting terrorism - areas the Bush camp saw as positives not long ago.
47,Yesterday was my second official Father's Day - and I spent it fittingly 'fathering' my daughter Erin who got a stomach bug over the weekend.
47,Not only will I breathe a huge sigh of relief but I can start writing about what I really want to write about - the things I used to care about before I got sucked into the world of politics: the Mets movies TV shows graphic novels (OK comics) and other such relatively trivial subjects.
47,No I didn't get to go - unfortunately but 'Fahrenheit 911' had its premiere last night and one of my heroes Tom Tomorrow (really Dan Perkins) who draws the great 'This Modern World' political strip was there: 'Went to the premiere last night along with many fabulous celebrities.
47,The UK Daily Telegraph tells us that an 'American television network' is set to take this Bush-damagaing story a few notches higher this very week: 'New evidence that the physical abuse of detainees in Iraq and at Guantanamo Bay was authorised at the top of the Bush administration will emerge in Washington this week adding further to pressure on the White House.
47,I've been off to Chicago for a long weekend with my wife at the BookExpo America convention - the one with Bill Clinton's speech you may have heard about.
47,I'm back - the show was a lot of fun (plus I got some actual WORK done) - details to come...
47,It used to be that incumbent presidents ran for re-election in a dignified way - 'from the Rose Garden' is how it was commonly put.
47,I'll have this posted on the website (bn.com) soon - it's not something GW Bush is going to enjoy reading (not that there's any chance THAT'S gonna happen).
47,From Reuters: July 11 2004 — WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior House Democratic lawmaker was skeptical on Sunday of a Bush administration idea to obtain the authority to delay the November presidential election in case of an attack by al Qaeda U.S. counterterrorism officials are looking at an emergency proposal on the legal steps needed to postpone the presidential election in case of such an attack Newsweek reported on Sunday.
47,It sure seems as if the only way the GOP-controlled House of Representatives can get what they (and of course the White House) wants is to BREAK THE RULES.
47,OK here's today's big news headline: 'RIDGE: Al-Queda Plotting Strike No specific threat; alert status unchanged' (USA Today) Is it just me or do these vague unspecified threats always seem to pop up just when the polls turn sharply against the Appointed-Resident-In-Chief Nothing like instilling a little frantic fear in the minds of the electorate to stop the ratings slide.
47,This is the best pick JFK2 could have made.
47,Well for this year at least.
47,Taking a few days off away from the mighty blogosphere - hope eveyone has a great holiday weekend.
47,When I'm not wearing my political hat I've usually got my 'Geek Gear' on - I not only buy graphic novels for bn.com but we're also starting to dabble in those expensive comic-related collectibles items you see at comic shops like Forbidden Planet.
47,Interesting new headline on CNN.com this morn: 'U.S.
47,Thought of a great new Kerry campaign sticker on the subway this morning: BUSH/FEAR 2004 Because it's pretty freaking obvious that the Bushies intend to issue scare warnings every time they deem it politically useful.
42,Today the hall is full of sweets and crisps and packets of sliced bread.
42,On Monday Morning the staff meeting was at Anthony's as usual and I have decided to try putting notes about it out on this.

42,The Rector thinks bits of St Mary's would WORK better if the information and dynamism of our Church Family was accurate up-to-date and accessible.
42,Gina Anthony Steve Jill and I sat outside on a lovely sunny day for this week's meeting and Anthony prayed that we would all look forward to God's love new and have it fresh everyday not try to store lots up to use later.
42,Today the Church was packed full of lilies from Saturday's wedding between a french lady and her english groom appropriate given the news was full of the D Day Commemorative events in Normandy.
42,I was up all night worrying about what I wrote yesterday.
42,The Pentecost Weekend was very busy a pretty bride married her groom on Saturday and I have a tape of the service to send to a young woman in America who is coming home to be married next year and wants to know something to set her mind on.
42,Tuesday 29th June I skived off choir practice in order to have an early night ready for starting the journey to Dover at 5.45am.
42,Well it's almost 4 AM now and I stayed up late to pay bills.
42,I think the hardest part of starting a business is figuring out the time slots for everything that needs my immediate attention.
42,Most furniture is at its most basic level either a raised surface to put things on (in the case of chairs our butts) or a box to put things in.
44,NO NO NO Stoney Were are you You were just here I saw you and now you're gone.

42,According to today's regulators and bureaucrats those of us who were kids in the 60's 70's and early 80's probably shouldn't have survived because.... Our baby cots were covered with brightly coloured lead-based paint which was promptly chewed and licked.
