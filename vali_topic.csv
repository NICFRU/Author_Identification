Student,Info has been found (+/- 100 pages and 4.5 MB of .pdf files) Now i have to wait untill our team leader has processed it and learns html.
InvestmentBanking,Thanks to Yahoo's Toolbar I can now 'capture' the URLs of popups...which means now I can show you some cool links to Korean Pop (K-Pop) audio and video without the need to relate instructions like: 'go to the site click on the pop-audio button then choose...'.
InvestmentBanking,I had an interesting conversation with my Dad this morning.
InvestmentBanking,Somehow Coca-Cola has a way of summing up things so well.
InvestmentBanking,If anything Korea is a country of extremes.
InvestmentBanking,I surf the English news sites a lot looking for tidbits on Korea and how foreigners (like me) view the 'Hermit Kingdom' but also as a way to keep up with this fast-moving place.
InvestmentBanking,If you click on my profile you'll make a not-so-startling discovery...I was born in Year of the Pig as they say in the Korean/Chinese calendar.
InvestmentBanking,Last night was pretty fun...mostly because of the company I kept.
InvestmentBanking,There is so much that is different here from anything I've ever seen (well I haven't travelled that much just in Canada the US Philippines and Japan).
InvestmentBanking,Here is the latest from the Korean rumor mill (it made it all the way to Coquitlam and my wife's ears).
InvestmentBanking,So I've been in Vancouver a few days now...in Coquitlam actually.
InvestmentBanking,Whenever I see a pregnant Korean lady I really feel for her because I know that within a few months she will have a 3-5 year sentence to complete and utter child-rearing duties.
InvestmentBanking,My wife posed a strange question to me tonight.
InvestmentBanking,As readers will know my favorite airline is Singapore Air (SAI).
InvestmentBanking,When I was in Seoul these last few months I thought my wife had it kinda easy here with 'just' our 2 kids to take care of.
InvestmentBanking,Korea especially Seoul is pretty cool; and Canada especially Vancouver is pretty cool too.
InvestmentBanking,It seems everything is not all that smooth in Seoul concerning the recent changes.
InvestmentBanking,Koreans have a great sense of community.
InvestmentBanking,I used to cook for myself all the time (making bulggogi kalbi and even lasagna).
InvestmentBanking,I often wondered where the restauranteurs heated up the briquettes or brinks or rocks that they placed in the table for traditional Korean cooking...then I saw this.
InvestmentBanking,It feels like I didn't even leave this place which is a little scary.
InvestmentBanking,It's been a busy last couple of weeks but I'm on my way back to Seoul today.
InvestmentBanking,Some of you may remember my first article on oh-gyup-sal (five layers of fat pork).
InvestmentBanking,A readers will know shopping in Seoul is a little different from back home (assuming back home is a Western country like Canada the US UK...).
InvestmentBanking,In any developing country (and I believe Korea is 'developing' and really only started on the road to a real economy with the onset of real elections in 1994) there can be trials and tribulations for those who lead (politicians heads of business) and follow (workers students).
InvestmentBanking,Just so you know this blog isn't about being political.
InvestmentBanking,Korea is as you may have guessed a hyper-competitive place.
InvestmentBanking,Ok you're probably looking at that title and wondering what the heck the connection is.
InvestmentBanking,Yahoo Finally after being in Seoul for almost 2 years we closed our first deal.
InvestmentBanking,I came across this in my daily readings of Korean news and sites...just trying to get a handle on this place.
InvestmentBanking,Man how do I come across some of this stuff.
InvestmentBanking,Ok it's not at all scientific.
InvestmentBanking,Man with all that is going on I can see my posting to the ol' blog getting bogged down the next couple of week.

indUnk,“That’s not fair” I work with a ton of little kids so this statement is too well known.
indUnk,Some people say “It’s not where you are going that matters it’s the journey on the way.” This may be true for some; however there are those who see it through my eyes.
indUnk,Death can be a scary thing.
indUnk,People are always saying “Just be yourself”.

Student,went to Jurong East for lunch today with limRoyTheoWilsonJerren.
Student,Today we had bible study after school.
indUnk,Well I hate to start off no such a sour note but things haven't been going so great with me lately and here's the dirty.
Non-Profit,i have developed a pain in my chest that is quite worrying; whether it has arisen from an almost entirely carbohydrate-based diet or from over-stretching during an impromptu kata is unclear; the fact that it is making it harder to sleep is undeniable.
Non-Profit,i have been given a book to read one that will 'change the way i think'.
Non-Profit,(it is never good to start on a digression.
Non-Profit,is getting up at five in the afternoon more acceptable if you went to bed at five in the morning i hope so.
Non-Profit,we are drinking and talking of unrequited love.
Non-Profit,in a moment of clarity i looked up the tablature for 'tightrope' by the stone roses.
Non-Profit,an incident yesterday when a girl i was talking to on messenger clicked 'accept' for webcam feed before realising that she wasn't actually wearing a top.
Non-Profit,whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre.
Non-Profit,five in the afternoon is not a good time to be eating breakfast.
Non-Profit,hiya i have some observations i'd like to share; like how sometimes it seems easier to go out of your way for people you don't know and how once you start ignoring the 'phone it becomes easier and easier not to ever pick it up.
Non-Profit,i love the british railway system; who else would write to you to let you know they are going to write to you maybe i should write back: dear sir; thank you for your letter warning me of your impending letter; i was however startled to receive said advance letter without prior notice... i ask for the complaint forms with the tickets these days; it saves time.
Non-Profit,oh and i meant to say everything's going to be alright.
Non-Profit,quotes of the day: 'there should be more good stuff everywhere.'
Non-Profit,let me introduce you to a place i've heard of; a place that does not exist.
Non-Profit,there is a sign in the window of the local hairdressers that says 'models required'.
Non-Profit,no toaster let nature do all the hard work a nice crispiness to bread can be achieved by simply placing the bread on a plate out in the open for several hours before consumption.
Non-Profit,(more of these as i think of them) i) have a shower really late at night wash your hair.
Non-Profit,you misread a product advertisment saying 'acid free' as 'free acid'.
Non-Profit,of all the foodstuffs not recommended for the just-before-bedtime slot cheese with chilli sauce has probably got to feature somewhere near the top.
Non-Profit,the loan adverts that are currently plaguing the television annoy me; i have begun to see the pattern they follow: i) having trouble paying bills ii) problems getting loans elsewhere iii) reduce your monthly payments iv) take your family on holiday or buy a new kitchen v) call now.
Non-Profit,if lack of sleep leads to an involuntary lowering of defences then therapy this morning indirectly benefitted.
Non-Profit,the humidity of recent days has lead to increased insomnia but has also lead to the first five minutes of returning home into a game of how fast the vast majority of my clothes can be removed.
Non-Profit,a slow day; getting things done like cutting your toenails tend not to count as truly productive they are to the working day as shampoo is to the shopping list: something that occasionally has to be done but more of an imposition than anything else.
Non-Profit,terrestrial british television is currently enjoying the simultaneous playing of great films: 2 has pulp fiction 3 has unbreakable and 4 has the shawshank redemption.
Non-Profit,it seems that i am a difficult person to get hold of; or so i have been recently told by more than a couple of people.
Non-Profit,night is the worst; its when i wander more when sounds seem louder and when i still find time to talk to her memory.
Non-Profit,what an entertaining morning after the insights of therapy and the delight of having already had a shower (joy) i headed off to the shortest film festival in the world (...ever).
Non-Profit,and no i'm not talking about the incessant rain.
Non-Profit,i never figured on any of this; that much you should know.
Non-Profit,the well-meaning drunk: oh sure their heart's in the right place and i'm glad he stopped by to apologise for all the noise and such but at half four in the morning there are better things i can think of doing.
Non-Profit,quote of the day is good even out of context: 'there are things you don't do.
Banking,So many things I could talk about today.
Banking,when I was hanging out with Dino.
Banking,Ugh finally the only show worth watching on TV has come along.
Banking,We always hear statistics stating we are an aging nation but how does that really affect us All the advances in health care and medicine have people who might not have otherwise survived living till their 80's and 90's.
Banking,There are days it seems i have to much to say and no one to say it to.
Banking,that's what I would truly like to beeeeeee.
Banking,that's all i want to say to youuuuu.
Banking,so much and so much and so much...
Banking,I was thinkin back to a poem I wrote a while ago thought I had saved a copy...and now can't find it...I am going to try to get it back out of the deep recesses of my brain though.
Banking,Sometimes when you look for something so hard you don't see that what you need might be right in front of you.
Banking,what the hell is that dammit I just had a flu I don't want another I have to go back to work on Monday IIIICCCCKKKKKYYY I went there today to see what was up and found out they moved my desk or at least they will on Monday...so I will get to unpack all my stuff and set my junk up again lol.
indUnk,I had this conversation with a man the other evening... more of an argument I suppose or at least a debate...
indUnk,Have you ever read 'The picture of Dorian Gray' by Oscar Wilde It is an interesting book... here is an interesting bit I just came across reading today... (I'm rereading the book haven't read it in years) ~~'Only when one is young' she answered.
indUnk,Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.
indUnk,'Scars heal glory fades and all we're left with are the memories made pain hurts but only for a minute life is short so go on and live it.'
indUnk,' Life isn't a journey to the grave with the intentions of arriving safely in a pretty & well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out & loudly proclaiming DAMN what a Ride'
indUnk,First you should read my profile.
indUnk,Ok. Maybe that last entry was typed with rose colored glasses on... he is a very great guy but I never get to see him that much.
indUnk,It never ceases to amaze me how wonderful it is to go to Steven's farm ... out in the middle of nowhere with a half mile long driveway... it is quiet secluded... beautiful... not to mention that Steve is the most wonderful man on the planet...
indUnk,I have the night off... And I'm spending the day and probably the night at Steven's...
indUnk,I have had an on-again off-again relationship with Steven for the last three years.
indUnk,Arwen If I were a character in The Lord of the Rings I would be Arwen Elf the daughter of Elrond.
indUnk,Last night my night off I ended up working from midnight to 4:30 am because my best friend at work pulled a no-show no-call... he showed up at 4 seems he and his girlfriend were fighting all day and he took off too mad to think about coming to work... hmmm... he'd better grow out of that maybe take some anger management classes and maybe get rid of the girlfriend if she's gonna be that much trouble...just because two people have a child together doesn't mean they were meant to be together forever...
indUnk,This place is wearing on me like it did growing up here.
Student,'PAinkiller' The past is like a gaping hole No matter how hard you try to run from it You just find that you are running in circles You think of the cause and effect Every action you have made The scar which the past had inflicted cannot be healed Like a wounded bird trapped in a cage You realize that the same mistakes being made Your conscience hunted you You start to doubt yourself Asking yourself the same questions over and over again You felt weak No longer the will to walk on Prayers to god was a momentarily salvation But never was it a cure Painkillers ease but not your pain As you see your love ones One by one Vanishing into the darkness When you tried to grasp and treasure them They were all gone Your eyes were hollow empty without life When you tried to love another Mistakes were repeated Sorrows and misery embedded Deepened and worsened
Student,A cup filled with the rainbow of colours Each signify a different meaning Some surfaced to simplicity others hid deep meanings Colours varied in different forms When blue might appear blue Often it does not I was a boy A simple boy My appearance my shell My face my mask My heart is so disguise I fear so much to reveal my true self Will others shy from me Will the people who care for me leave Will I be alone So many questionsso many answers I need to know Fatigue washed over me like a tidal wave Maintaining the cloak sapped my strength The weight of the world weigh down upon me Nothing seems to aid Still I have to carry on Battling against an unseen enemy
Student,Time past like a dragging cart I studied the sea of sweaty faces Some delighted in mirth Others solemn and distant While I struggled with my apparent task The weight of the rifle seems to drag me down Blood flowed from cuts Pain and fatigue weakened my determined mind I lick the dry skin of my lips My feet turn from flesh to lead My mind and eyes wandered As sun faded out of view The day ended The weight of responsibilities and rules lifted from my shoulders A young primary student walk past me Reminding me how fortunate they were But still they have to face the inevitable weight of responsibilities And the winding paths of failures
Student,“We must not fail our duty let us ride on” Lysandros barked a command as he spurred his steed onwards.

Arts,Current Music: Could It Be Magic - Donna Summer Feeling: blah Ok I'm late.
Internet,Woohoo - she'll be here tomorrow - which probably means I need to clean the place up a bit - uh oh :( Since Jen's going to get a car we'll be able to at least grab some furniture so she'll have somewhere to sit - and she has timed it perfectly for the pool opening on the weekend.
Internet,That's right this is the week Jen arrives on Thursday and will be staying right through to the following Sunday - Yay :) Also on the good news front I now have Cable TV Broadband and a new mattress.
Internet,I'll be getting bot a new mattress and cable TV/Cable internet on Saturday.
Internet,My stuff from Ireland arrived this morning - so I now have all my CD's DVD's clothes etc.
Internet,I've decided to document my little adventure in America.
Internet,Not so much from the what happened point of view as from the 'thank God it's over' point of view.
Internet,Well now that things are settling down a bit I find I have a bit of spare time on my hands.
Internet,Woohoo - I got my learners permit This time I got every question right though if I'd had this test last time I would have had no trouble then either - just the luck of the draw I guess..... Now all I have to do is learn how to drive before my car arrives next month :) Yesterday was a pretty good day all round in fact - as well as the successful test the Pistons destroyed the Lakers.
Internet,Just realised I never mentioned the new chair - My Lazboy arrived on Saturday and I'm glad tosay it rocks :) On the bad side of things - I managed to fail the theory test on the Virginia drivers license exam so I have to re-take it tomorrow........grrrr What's annoying is that I needed 20 correct out of 25 and I got 19 - the last question was how much more likely you are to have an accident if you are drunk - 5 times 7 times 10 times or 12 times.
Internet,Finally got around to installing linux (fedora core2) on the laptop - it is working quite well I even have wireless networking going on it using the Netgear WG511 card I bought a while back - Nice :) Also have the bare bones for 2 new systems - one dual PIII 1Ghz and one dual PIII 866.
Internet,Jen left last night and it was 10 times worse than when we said goodbye back in the Old Country - at least then I had all the excitement of going to a new job a new country a new apartment etc.
Internet,My apartment now looks like someone actually lives there my DVD's CD's and books are up off the floor though not arranged in any meaningful order yet ;) As soon as the desk arrives (should be tomorrow) I'll post some decent pictures of the whole thing.
Internet,Unfortunately it sems that my webhosting company has gone tits up.
Internet,OK I knew that the whole Atkins diet low carb thing was big in the US but I was still surprised when I got here at how pervasive the whole thing is.
Internet,Decided it was time to flex my coding muscles this week so I've put together a little tool that converts IP Addresses URL's and Host names into Autonomous System numbers and gives a few other little tidbits while it's at it too.
Internet,Went to see Spiderman 2 last night - have to say that I liked it - didn't have the fun of the first one when you were learning how they were going to implement all the superpowers and stuff but still good none the less.

Banking,12th August After a long thought about what to post in my second blog I am still clueless and my imagination seems to abscond when I need it the most.
Banking,‘The Da Vinci Code’ by Dan Brown is one book that has taken world by storm.
Technology,In an earlier post Johnathan said: 'And then: What of Gregory Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun patrolling the darkness that lurks therein ........
Technology,I'd post this on the RTG Blog but I can't post there.
Technology,The answer to the first question lies with Master Po; the answer to the second is Sister Jayna the priestess who took over after Castillion departed.
Technology,it seems odd to think of brother ian as having a father.
Technology,since our next game is the weekend of halloween why don't we all dress up like our characters next session
Technology,- Hillsfar ruled by Lord Malthiir believed by the party to be a former gang/crime lord who came to power by unknown means.
Technology,perhaps we can have it that if an email is sent out that a confirmation email can be sent back.
Technology,Mir -- Ben said something about 50/50.
Technology,I don't know how long RTG will last.
Technology,and as far as characters go i like luc - i want to see where her story goes - i've committed over 2 years to seeing how she would develop and i want to see the ending.
Technology,and i don't even believe that duellacathata is actually dead.
Technology,To be fair Duellacathata didn't directly frame the party; that was (supposedly) the desire of K'Sh'Aal (or rather his/her/its representative).
Technology,i'm going to stick with Ian for now.
Technology,Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian) the group will be at an interesting crux: What Next The party is now international in membership and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.
Technology,Referring to Johnathan's post I think that the party clearly does not have the same goals.
Technology,[ Mon Oct 06 05:44:17 PM | hot chocolate ] oh burne how i miss thee and thine control over ye big mouthed monk.
Technology,To paraphrase JMS of B5 fame one might consider this the story of a platoon in WWII.
Technology,dude i have no idea where that notebook is now but i get your point.
Technology,[ Mon Oct 06 12:11:48 PM | hot chocolate ] and the cast still remaining from the first season are: Scott Moran (Gregory) Miriam Maddux (Luc) Ben Haley (Brother Ian) Jimi Harrell (Rhanellus) the scoobys and of course the god of us all Johnathan Shipley.
Technology,Perhaps you can make notes to yourself during the game as John did.
Technology,very interesting but hard to keep in head all at once.
Technology,Hey folks -- check your email No game today.
Technology,i will be there for the entire game this week.
Technology,Even funnier if you replace the guys with a drow a beholder and an illithid.
Technology,joke moved to circle of irony err...actually not.
Technology,i will be at the next game
Technology,The road to glory is currently a quiet one it seems.
Technology,Hey You buckle your swashes someplace else pal This is a family friendly joint
Technology,man that was like one of the best games ever....
Technology,this is what i also look for in relationships: No More Messy 'Inky' Towels and Hands Easy Break Down and Assembly Customizing Evolving Map Standard One Inch (1') Grids
Technology,RTG Party 1.0 () indicates Blood of Tilvernus - Burne Trinson Paladin of Heironeous of Tilverton - Brother Ian Monk of Tilverton - Boris Borovich Fighter of Tilverton - Gregory Sendant Ranger/Fighter of Tilverton - Luc Bard of Cormyr - Rhanellus Sorcerer/Fighter heritage unknown RTG Party 2.0 changes: Boris Borovich returns to Tilverton; Connor joins in Shadowdale - Burne Trinson Paladin of Heironeous - Brother Ian Monk - Gregory Sendant Ranger/Fighter - Luc Bard - Rhanellus Sorcerer/Fighter - Connor McClaren Rogue/Wizard of Hillsfar RTG Party 3.0 changes: Fennie joins in the Underdark - Burne Trinson Paladin - Brother Ian Monk - Gregory Sendant Ranger/Fighter - Luc Bard - Rhanellus Sorcerer/Fighter - Connor McLaren Rogue/Wizard - Hermione Fenwick Rogue of Sembia RTG Party 4.0 changes: Burne departs for Rashemen; Gregory acquires new talents; Adan joins in Hillsfar - Brother Ian Monk - Gregory Sendant Ranger/Fighter/Druid - Luc Bard - Rhanellus Sorcerer/Fighter - Connor McLaren Rogue/Wizard - Hermione Fenwick Rogue - Adan Cleric of Fharlangn of the Great Dale RTG Party 5.0 changes: Brother Ian and Gregory choose to deliver news to Tilverton; three as-yet unknown heroes join - Luc Bard - Rhanellus Sorcerer/Fighter - Connor McLaren Rogue/Wizard - Hermione Fenwick Rogue - Adan Cleric of Fharlangn - Unknown #1 - Unknown #2 - Unknown #3 Party 5.0 will represent 8 different geographic regions of Faerun -- none of them Tilverton.

Law,it's one of quotations that i got from our daily bread.. (not a name of bakery shop ).. when i read that quotations.. i was speechless.. it's not just a sentence.. but the meaning of the sentence really comforts me.. i am not too religious though.. i almost attend every sunday service.. i even join 2 choirs in my church.. (heh) but still.. so each time i have problem or so many problems i always try so hard to remember that sentence.. somehow.. it works.. that sentence can strengthen me.. i know god works in any way that can't be understandable.. or so unpredictable for us -a human being- but i know he'll always there for me.. not only for reminding me of the good... but to carry me.. in my devastated time... p.s: i think 'my good side' is all around me when i write this heheheeheheheee....
