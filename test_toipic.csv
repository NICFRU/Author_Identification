Student,I woke up to the 'rents fighting.
Student,Goodness I have had nothing to do this whole day.
Student,Okay so I found the magical wonders of xanga and I must say they've won me over.
Student,I cant believe that im actually making another online journal/diary thing.
Student,What a shitty 4th of July.
Student,So today was pretty damn uneventful.
Student,GOD DAMN IT This is another major reason why I hate writing online.
Student,One of my favorite topics..Its there cuz I had always been intrigued with it...And the intrigue ceased when I decided to try it out..But it wasn't for fun...I just felt bad....Felt alone...Desperate..
Student,Death-..Once again on my mind that simple desire for something that only time can bring...Or maybe that accident I've always dreamed of...To die doing something I love...Or just walking down the street...Alone...As always...Just to die now...Alone...All alone leaving nothing behind..No one to cry for my death..My disappearance...For the way I just left for my own will...I had gone because I wanted to...I really do..I wish it would be as easy as it seems...I mean..Its just dying..I actually don't care where I'll go after death..It doesn't matter where my destiny shall take me when I'm gone..As long as I was gone....As for what I believe...Anything is better than being alive and having to be right here...Right now....As if there was anything left for me in this world...Anything worth my time..Anything worth living...Anything worth that so called 'limited time' God.. (as if he was real jajaja) gives people is just shit...At least for me it is...If anyone could ever want it..Hey its yours...Its not like I'm gonna use it in anything better...I feel as if I didn't need it...As if there was no use in having to live...Living was just meaningless...I was..And am gonna die anyways...So why not just do it now.....Why live anything more.Some say life toughens you by experience...Bad experience...But I don't want to get any tougher...No more experiences...No more suffering....No more life...Please I beg you...Take this away from me....Take my life where I cant ever find it again..Take it somewhere else...Hide it....Disappear it....Make it fade away...Put it in a box...Lock it away...Lock everything I once had away...Feelings..Memories...Thoughts....Wishes...Dreams...Take it all away...I don't want it in me anymore...I just want emptiness...I want to feel nothing..At all...Just to be empty inside...So that I don't have to go through anything that could harm me...Ever again...Just to be hole...Empty.....Useless....
Student,“There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is only the comparison of one state with another.
Student,There she was..Standing there in the middle of the night..All tied up inside because of her problems...No where to go...No one to save her from what she was becoming....Losing her self in the atmosphere...Loosing her self in no ones dreams...Loosing her self in between....Lost...Trying to find her way...Getting nowhere...Trying to find a place...A spot to stop hiding...Start facing what was going on in her life...To start realizing NOTHING was alright...And it was never going to be...Not ever....Never again..To realize..That she had lost it all...
Student,'I walk down the face of this Earth alone.
Student,There I stood..In that dark cold night...Staring right into those eyes who had been watching me as I walked through that dark...Endless forest....Those eyes that had watched me...That had followed me..All the way through the forest....Then I got lost...That's the only reason I saw the eyes on the first place..I felt watched ever since I entered the forest....But I didn't want to look back...So I just went on...But now...I was lost...I got lost and looked all around...But I stopped in the eyes...Dark eyes...I could only see some little shine on the...But no color...Just shine..And I was freaked...I looked into those eyes..But wasn't scared at all...Those eyes seemed to be admiring me...Meant no harm...But as I looked at them they drank my essence..I didn't feel anything..I just felt tired...But I wasn't tired...I was just dying...Slowly...Maybe too slow to notice what was happening...To really know that I wasn't ok..That my life...My essence was taken away from me...Because I got lost and looked into those eyes...Then I died...After hours of staring...I died...Those eyes took all my Essence...They took my soul...They took all that made me...Well...Me...

Engineering,Critics are well wishers in disguise Hey Hash everything meta begins from something abstract...coz even emotions are abstract Few run away from what they feel is true coz they want to believe it otherwise and hoodwink themselves.But truth is something like an air packet under a water body...itz gonna come up and burst your bubble.
Engineering,well some words of advice for Diablo and BABA ..man u guys talk so meta physical ..its so hysterically rubbish ... its more like u guys talking on a topic like 'PHYSICS OF SCIENCE' even though its crazy u can just bluff abt it and make it sound sensible ..LOL hehehe ..dnt take it personally Assi can be a good writer..he shldnt waste his talent..
Engineering,......A PORTAL is created for everyone to commune & share their vibes...alas mortals are always tied to a materialistic bondage....commitments & expectations pull them apart from what they are destined to commit & act....for itz only after death they realize their chance has slipped...& all they have got is eternity to atone their sins....do remember life is brief but after death lies the real test
Engineering,just for smiles Hey guys Please give due credit to Mr Rao he has this to say regarding a blog post about microsft.
Engineering,U know Diablo every person has a aura (I mean the one that is seen around the head of great people) Now only children see this aura and when u grow up will not be able to see it.
Engineering,Life is indeed a funny musical chair competition....the music keeps ringing in your ears ripping your tender ear membranes....for a fewLady Luck smiles & they get a seat...others keep running in the dark...banging their heads..bruising their bodies..wrecking their confidences...they just keep running hoping that the music is going to stop the next instant Alas mortals are blessed only with that...HOPE -Diablo-
Engineering,Hi people Hw u guys doing i wanted to knw who is Diablo aka Dreamer_80 A couple of things.

Engineering,Hi dudes My first post to this forum.
Engineering,wasp guys...sorry for my late responses...will be more proactive...
Arts,So today I got the new YM that the company insists on sending me although I did not pay for it.
Arts,I found this article today and I thought it was thought provoking...lets hear what you all think.
Arts,Do you know how hard it is to get somebody into church that doesn't believe in God I do.
Arts,We should admit we're broken... because when I feel judged by a Christian of all people it is the worst feeling in the world.
Arts,At Vespers last nite we had the opportunity to hear a wonderful message by a freshman here at the college.
Arts,Have you ever really needed to talk to someone but you haven't been able to come up with the right words to say.
Arts,I think that you've handled it absolutely perfectly.
Arts,Why is it so hard to talk to people about God I am a Christian and I know that every chance that I get I should talk about him but I know that I am not the perfect Christian so I feel like I cant talk about him.
Arts,What really bothers me is people say they don't have time for God.
Arts,You know what I get sick of....well...actually a whole lotta stuff....God did give me a critical spirt....I have to use it...but anyway...back to this specific instance of agitation...I really don't like how Christians do their best to try and not be controversial...we don't talk about politics..we don't discuss the latest news...we don't discuss the holes that exist in the bible...we don't go out on a limb and say things that might .....just might....make a whole lotta sense... everyone is in the same boat.....i have realized that a lot of christians think that church...the instituion...not just our church... is not doing a good job...but no one says anything...for two reasons....one....the same people who think there are a whole lot problems don't have any solutions....or two....they know the problems and have a good guess at solutions...but are too scared to vocalize their beliefs because they are scared what the other people in the room will think about them... give you an example...I was at this convention and we were supposed to break up in groups of five or six and do some dumb exercise that was really just an excuse for the speaker to go pee...and I was talking with this group of three youth workers from seattlle who were starting this new ministry...we were talking about effective ways to minister...and I said that maybe the best solution is to not come into ministry thinking we have all the answers...that maybe Christianity doesn't answer all life's question...btw...i am a little reluctant to write this on this blog...so don't tell anybody....anyway...these three folks from Seattle looked at me like I was the anti-Christ.....later we were told to pray in those groups about our ministries...I was thinking the whole time that I was praying out loud that those three people must think that God doesn't even listen to my prayers.... the worst kind of judgement is silent judgement...if you are gonna think that I am a heretic at least tell it to my face...instead of going back to your regular group and telling a story about this crazy extremist you met at a youth convention... alright...rant ended...
Arts,On my way to church yesterday I began to reflect on what Megan wrote about her friends.
Arts,I know there are some people who are turned off to God no matter what.
Arts,You know it seems that there are just some folks out there that don't get it...that will never get it....like God has really hardened their hearts....it seems so stupid...but I don't know if Christ came to save everyone...whenver he took the cup at the Last Supper he said 'this blood is shed for many for the remission of sin' notice that he didn't say everyone.
Arts,I'm getting lonely sitting here bored realizing it's 1 pm on a Sunday and I bet a lot of people at the FBC are having lots of fun... Robb Where are you when I need to use you for a ride ...I kid I kid... By the way I was kind of 'sadded out' when a guy from the youth group came up to me the other day.
Arts,I think Katie is right on with her advice.
Arts,By the way I am having a graduation party at my house on May 23rd... at 4 pm... if anyone wants to come... my mom is a freak and has lots of food for everyone...
Arts,Abercrombie and Fitch put pictures of naked people on their bags when you get stuff from a store.
Arts,So...tonite was my last night ever at a Greenville College chapel type event...now let me tell you...that is an odd odd thing...I was taken aback not because of the music or the atmosphere...but the fact that its over....no more of the same stuff for the last four years...time for me to grow up and face the world and all that garbage.. (begin rant) you know what I am sick of...the christian subculture...I am absolutely sick of how restrictive it is...we have a christian book store on campus..actually about fifty feet from apartment...there is this little poster in the window of this store that says 'EXPERIENCE THE PASSION HERE'....what in the world does all that crap mean....I don't what to be crucified...I read the book...why in the world would someone want to experience that.... what really got me is....all the crap that this bookstore has about the passion....there are books and cds and necklaces...necklaces for goodness sakes...these people are exploiting the death of my messiah...the savior of the world has been reduced to a fake nail hanging on a piece of leather around some thirteen year old kid in the midwest...and we are fine with that...because its at least not a hemp necklace or something....
Arts,Be thou my vision O Lord of my heart Naught be all else to me save that thou art Thou my best thought by day or by night Waking or sleeping thy presence my light.
Arts,I don't know what's wrong but lately I haven't even been able to concentrate enough on praying to do it for just a few minutes.

Automotive,Who hasn't had enough of the 'newsertainment' industry What ever happened to responsible and ethical news reporting Who are the instructors and professors who are teaching our nation's young men and women to 'report' the news in the manner that we read and hear on a daily basis Are these instructors and professors not the 'Michael Moores' of journalism who do not consider their methods and stories to be the bane but the best of the business How many university professors make C. John Sommerville's 'How The News Makes Us Dumb' required reading How many university instructors would make 'Bias' written by Bernard Goldberg required reading Isn't Fox News considered 'conservative' by some because their own views being tilted far to the left and embracing a pronounced anti-Christian anti-American worldview hinder their ability to perceive level ground or an objective worldview Well O.K.

Construction,A while ago when i started talking about going on a diet for the wedding Andrew said as my reward if i could lose 10kilos by June 3rd he would give me a day at a spa: facials massages the works :) so that is what my reward is to myself and also one of my earlier goals...

Construction,Well I woke up sick this morning to the point of not being able to go to work...so I did great in the food department LOL....ate about one meal's worth of food today....no exercise though...so that's bad.
Construction,I wanted to add two of the 'diets' that I've considered.
Construction,I'm still running around trying to get ready for my trip (see my blog for the gory details) but I figured Aleta and Misty had a good idea with the stating goals bit so here are mine: I'm hovering around 16/18/20 depending on the item and weigh between 215 and 220.

Chemicals,Dane should've written something by now but when he viewed our hit count yesterday he freaked out and is currently huddled under a coffee table and whimpering.
