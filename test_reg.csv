36,Sometimes I think the moment I become single 'I AM SINGLE' is immediately emblazoned on my forehead for only assholes to see.
17,One tear falls; I wipe away before they see Before they get the chance to see the weakness inside of me Because of my pride it is so difficult to reveal It's so hard to show anyone how I really feel The heart in my chest may be breaking in two But you won't ever see me shed a tear or cry in front of you So I'll bury my feelings deep down inside again They could resurface but I don't know where or when I am scared of nothing but I always feel afraid And from their critical eyes I am trying to evade Keeping what lies within me right where it belongs Speaking to no one of my sad and lovely songs I wanted to feel nothing and this wish is coming true That's what happens when I try to hide myself away from you I guess should feel sadder now that I am turning numb But when offered a life unfeeling it's so easy to succumb The pain is gone away now but the joy has left me too I move about like a shadow with my vision all askew This isn't what I wanted if I could I would feel fear But I can't so what I'll shed for you is one small simple tear.
17,Midnight soft is how I love you Like a secret in the night Moonlight sweet is how I need you Whether it be wrong or right When it's dark outside I hold you And I'm not ashamed to say That my heart's longing to touch you But so quickly comes the day And as quickly you are gone When my sky turns pale and light We are never the same at dawn As we were that very night With night time comes my dreams And I suppose that's what you are But underneath the moonbeams I know you're never far Still when day comes you leave And I die a little inside The sun and I are left to grieve For the moon's love will not bide On your violin I watch you play A tune of love untold But with sunrise comes the day And soon the song turns cold Then all day I lie in waiting For the sun to fade from view And as the sunlight starts abating I make my way to you Now I've had a revelation One day I'll let you see It's not my imagination Or a school girl's fantasy One night I will reveal A love you've never known I'll prove that what I feel is real And stop loving on my own Midnight soft is how I love you Whether it be day or night Moonlight sweet is how I need you In darkness or the light.
17,Each night I look up to the sky And see the Lord in every star But for some reason I know not why I find him not in the moon afar I see a face but he looks cold Up in space the time he bides Near the ocean rocks so old Ever changing with the tides God for me does not waver Like the moon does every night To me God is my bless'd savior An always constant shinning light But somehow it's different now The closest star seems distant And though the sun will not allow My moon turns to a crescent I move quickly against the waves Others come but I must go Past all the people the Lord saves If I'm one the sun will show Its futile whispering prayers to the moon The man speaks not to me For the night is gone too soon And then the moon must flee I realize I am like that sphere So weary dark and low And only when the sun is near Am I allowed to glow I revolve around the earth As the earth goes round the sun From the moment of my birth And until my life is done I'm not afraid of the sea anymore With the current I am intune As I wonder on this distant shore About God the ocean and the moon
17,Childhood friendships dwindle away so fast Caught beneath the dead hand of the past It fades like the photos on our shelves With no one left to blame but ourselves We didn't know what we'd had until it was gone And it breaks my heart to see you so withdrawn Did I ever tell you how sorry I feel And all of this now seems so unreal I wish I had been a better friend But I was too young to comprehend The terror inside your mind and delve Into the dark shadows I was only twelve.
17,These days nostalgia is lost on me I live for now instead of what will be Too happy to look back on yesterday I wish we could stay forever this way Such beautiful moments go by too fast Seconds minutes and hours slip past Until all are gone; the day will end Knowing tomorrow you'll still be my friend Together up to the stars we gaze Singing 'These are the good old days' When I'm with you I'm never judged I'm beside you when my makeups smudged My hairs in a mess and my jeans are torn Others look at me to frown and scorn But you stand by and hold my hand I can always count on you to understand But the sand keeps falling in the hour glass And what is now too soon will pass Years will speed by leaving us in a daze All the while singing 'These are the good old days' The time of our parting draws on apace So I'll smile with you and save your place Forever if need be until you come home From wherever it is you've chosen to roam And though these tears may fall from my eyes I always knew we'd have to say our goodbyes I have no regrets though it hurts me so To look back on so long ago So one last time under the sun's warm rays We'll be singing 'These are the good old days' For Page
17,From the day you're born people give to you They give but never take They smile and cheer and wait for you They applaud all the progress you make They watch you grow into the life you live And as you live you learn It seems that all they do is give But get so little in return You notice how much these people care And help you become who you are You know they may not always be there But they'll never be too far Because what they give stays with you And helps you through the years It makes you want to give some too And wipe away other's tears Then you get your chance one day To pass on the love you've got So you help others on their way And grow to love them a lot The more you give you come to find That the ones you love love back And with each person that you are kind You see you get more when giving back
17,I watch as the gentle brook feeds the lake And I wonder how something so large Depends on something so small I smell the scent of fire; burning pine And I wonder if any aroma could ever Bring back as sweet of memories I watch the dragonflies dance on the water And I wonder if over the centuries Their dance has ever changed I feel the warm wind against my skin And I wonder truly if what I feel Is the gentle breath of God I watch the rocks break the water's flow And I wonder how long it will take Before the water breaks the rocks I take in the world that lay before me And I wonder if anything could be More serene or beautiful than this
17,Each year I go back home And dream my summer away It may not be my real address But it's where you'll find my heart So what is home but a relative term For home is where your family is Each year I meet my family And play my summer away They may not be blood related But they love me just the same So what is family but a relative term For a family is people who love Each year I go where I am loved And laugh my summer away They may not have a reason but they love me anyway So love is not a relative term Because when I'm loved I'm home

34,When my hubby's family had one of their cattles slaughtered for our own consumption suddenly I had a freezer-full of various beef cuts - ground soup bone steaks (minute cube top round rib eye porterhouse tenderloin T-bone) and roasts (rib eye chuck sirloin etc.).
34,This has been a real favorite in our family since I experimented with the original Chicken Curry recipe (thanks to Sassy's foodblog) to make use of beef (that's cheapest here and what we have in abundance).
34,I was supposed to post about Chicken Curry but I realized I was not able to take photos of the cooking Anyway I will just prepare the recipe page for its beef counterpart.
