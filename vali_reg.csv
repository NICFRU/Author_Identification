15,Info has been found (+/- 100 pages and 4.5 MB of .pdf files) Now i have to wait untill our team leader has processed it and learns html.
33,Thanks to Yahoo's Toolbar I can now 'capture' the URLs of popups...which means now I can show you some cool links to Korean Pop (K-Pop) audio and video without the need to relate instructions like: 'go to the site click on the pop-audio button then choose...'.
33,I had an interesting conversation with my Dad this morning.
33,Somehow Coca-Cola has a way of summing up things so well.
33,If anything Korea is a country of extremes.
33,I surf the English news sites a lot looking for tidbits on Korea and how foreigners (like me) view the 'Hermit Kingdom' but also as a way to keep up with this fast-moving place.
33,If you click on my profile you'll make a not-so-startling discovery...I was born in Year of the Pig as they say in the Korean/Chinese calendar.
33,Last night was pretty fun...mostly because of the company I kept.
33,There is so much that is different here from anything I've ever seen (well I haven't travelled that much just in Canada the US Philippines and Japan).
33,Here is the latest from the Korean rumor mill (it made it all the way to Coquitlam and my wife's ears).
33,So I've been in Vancouver a few days now...in Coquitlam actually.
33,Whenever I see a pregnant Korean lady I really feel for her because I know that within a few months she will have a 3-5 year sentence to complete and utter child-rearing duties.
33,My wife posed a strange question to me tonight.
33,As readers will know my favorite airline is Singapore Air (SAI).
33,When I was in Seoul these last few months I thought my wife had it kinda easy here with 'just' our 2 kids to take care of.
33,Korea especially Seoul is pretty cool; and Canada especially Vancouver is pretty cool too.
33,It seems everything is not all that smooth in Seoul concerning the recent changes.
33,Koreans have a great sense of community.
33,I used to cook for myself all the time (making bulggogi kalbi and even lasagna).
33,I often wondered where the restauranteurs heated up the briquettes or brinks or rocks that they placed in the table for traditional Korean cooking...then I saw this.
33,It feels like I didn't even leave this place which is a little scary.
33,It's been a busy last couple of weeks but I'm on my way back to Seoul today.
33,Some of you may remember my first article on oh-gyup-sal (five layers of fat pork).
33,A readers will know shopping in Seoul is a little different from back home (assuming back home is a Western country like Canada the US UK...).
33,In any developing country (and I believe Korea is 'developing' and really only started on the road to a real economy with the onset of real elections in 1994) there can be trials and tribulations for those who lead (politicians heads of business) and follow (workers students).
33,Just so you know this blog isn't about being political.
33,Korea is as you may have guessed a hyper-competitive place.
33,Ok you're probably looking at that title and wondering what the heck the connection is.
33,Yahoo Finally after being in Seoul for almost 2 years we closed our first deal.
33,I came across this in my daily readings of Korean news and sites...just trying to get a handle on this place.
33,Man how do I come across some of this stuff.
33,Ok it's not at all scientific.
33,Man with all that is going on I can see my posting to the ol' blog getting bogged down the next couple of week.
33,Ah finally...someone else I know is coming here from Canada for a visit.
33,Being gay in Korea is like being gay in the U.S. military...in 1950.
14,O= optimist P= pessimist My argument with myself: P: Nooooo Stop thinking about him O: Why He's my boyfriend.
14,I walk into the only entrance of my prison.
14,Why do I like him He's funny We have so much in common He is so cute We have the same sick mind He likes friends (I know huh) Unlike other guys he can actually match He is super sweet Never is he mad He is intelligent He is open almost... ok he's blunt He is witty He is NOT gay (see not all the good ones are) And yes ladys he is real... and taken.
14,I've fallen so deep so fast.
14,It's hard to think that we have less than a week together.
14,Stroke my face that's resting on your lap.
14,You may be wondering why my site is called 'Spaghetti Wall'.
14,I walk into a life long summer memory that I haven’t seen for two years.
14,I work at a day camp full of little kids.
14,What you are about to read is a “Quick Write”.
14,You think you’ve known yourself forever and will know yourself forever… until you change.
14,Have you ever felt so horrible: like a million knifes stabbing your body all at once.
14,“That’s not fair” I work with a ton of little kids so this statement is too well known.
14,Some people say “It’s not where you are going that matters it’s the journey on the way.” This may be true for some; however there are those who see it through my eyes.
14,Death can be a scary thing.
14,People are always saying “Just be yourself”.
14,Have you ever had the feeling you were alone Even though the whole world is surrounding you they aren’t really with you at all.
25,Election time has rolled around again.

17,went to Jurong East for lunch today with limRoyTheoWilsonJerren.
17,Today we had bible study after school.
23,Well I hate to start off no such a sour note but things haven't been going so great with me lately and here's the dirty.
25,i have developed a pain in my chest that is quite worrying; whether it has arisen from an almost entirely carbohydrate-based diet or from over-stretching during an impromptu kata is unclear; the fact that it is making it harder to sleep is undeniable.
25,i have been given a book to read one that will 'change the way i think'.
25,(it is never good to start on a digression.
25,is getting up at five in the afternoon more acceptable if you went to bed at five in the morning i hope so.
25,we are drinking and talking of unrequited love.
25,in a moment of clarity i looked up the tablature for 'tightrope' by the stone roses.
25,an incident yesterday when a girl i was talking to on messenger clicked 'accept' for webcam feed before realising that she wasn't actually wearing a top.
25,whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre.
25,five in the afternoon is not a good time to be eating breakfast.
25,hiya i have some observations i'd like to share; like how sometimes it seems easier to go out of your way for people you don't know and how once you start ignoring the 'phone it becomes easier and easier not to ever pick it up.
25,i love the british railway system; who else would write to you to let you know they are going to write to you maybe i should write back: dear sir; thank you for your letter warning me of your impending letter; i was however startled to receive said advance letter without prior notice... i ask for the complaint forms with the tickets these days; it saves time.
25,oh and i meant to say everything's going to be alright.
25,quotes of the day: 'there should be more good stuff everywhere.'
25,let me introduce you to a place i've heard of; a place that does not exist.
25,there is a sign in the window of the local hairdressers that says 'models required'.
25,no toaster let nature do all the hard work a nice crispiness to bread can be achieved by simply placing the bread on a plate out in the open for several hours before consumption.
25,(more of these as i think of them) i) have a shower really late at night wash your hair.
25,you misread a product advertisment saying 'acid free' as 'free acid'.
25,of all the foodstuffs not recommended for the just-before-bedtime slot cheese with chilli sauce has probably got to feature somewhere near the top.
25,the loan adverts that are currently plaguing the television annoy me; i have begun to see the pattern they follow: i) having trouble paying bills ii) problems getting loans elsewhere iii) reduce your monthly payments iv) take your family on holiday or buy a new kitchen v) call now.
25,if lack of sleep leads to an involuntary lowering of defences then therapy this morning indirectly benefitted.
25,the humidity of recent days has lead to increased insomnia but has also lead to the first five minutes of returning home into a game of how fast the vast majority of my clothes can be removed.
25,a slow day; getting things done like cutting your toenails tend not to count as truly productive they are to the working day as shampoo is to the shopping list: something that occasionally has to be done but more of an imposition than anything else.
25,terrestrial british television is currently enjoying the simultaneous playing of great films: 2 has pulp fiction 3 has unbreakable and 4 has the shawshank redemption.
25,it seems that i am a difficult person to get hold of; or so i have been recently told by more than a couple of people.
25,night is the worst; its when i wander more when sounds seem louder and when i still find time to talk to her memory.
25,what an entertaining morning after the insights of therapy and the delight of having already had a shower (joy) i headed off to the shortest film festival in the world (...ever).
25,and no i'm not talking about the incessant rain.
25,i never figured on any of this; that much you should know.
25,the well-meaning drunk: oh sure their heart's in the right place and i'm glad he stopped by to apologise for all the noise and such but at half four in the morning there are better things i can think of doing.
25,quote of the day is good even out of context: 'there are things you don't do.
33,So many things I could talk about today.
33,when I was hanging out with Dino.
33,Ugh finally the only show worth watching on TV has come along.
33,We always hear statistics stating we are an aging nation but how does that really affect us All the advances in health care and medicine have people who might not have otherwise survived living till their 80's and 90's.
33,There are days it seems i have to much to say and no one to say it to.
33,that's what I would truly like to beeeeeee.
33,that's all i want to say to youuuuu.
33,so much and so much and so much...
33,I was thinkin back to a poem I wrote a while ago thought I had saved a copy...and now can't find it...I am going to try to get it back out of the deep recesses of my brain though.
33,Sometimes when you look for something so hard you don't see that what you need might be right in front of you.
33,what the hell is that dammit I just had a flu I don't want another I have to go back to work on Monday IIIICCCCKKKKKYYY I went there today to see what was up and found out they moved my desk or at least they will on Monday...so I will get to unpack all my stuff and set my junk up again lol.
37,I had this conversation with a man the other evening... more of an argument I suppose or at least a debate...
37,Have you ever read 'The picture of Dorian Gray' by Oscar Wilde It is an interesting book... here is an interesting bit I just came across reading today... (I'm rereading the book haven't read it in years) ~~'Only when one is young' she answered.
37,Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.
37,'Scars heal glory fades and all we're left with are the memories made pain hurts but only for a minute life is short so go on and live it.'
37,' Life isn't a journey to the grave with the intentions of arriving safely in a pretty & well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out & loudly proclaiming DAMN what a Ride'
37,First you should read my profile.
37,Ok. Maybe that last entry was typed with rose colored glasses on... he is a very great guy but I never get to see him that much.
37,It never ceases to amaze me how wonderful it is to go to Steven's farm ... out in the middle of nowhere with a half mile long driveway... it is quiet secluded... beautiful... not to mention that Steve is the most wonderful man on the planet...
37,I have the night off... And I'm spending the day and probably the night at Steven's...
37,I have had an on-again off-again relationship with Steven for the last three years.
37,Arwen If I were a character in The Lord of the Rings I would be Arwen Elf the daughter of Elrond.
37,Last night my night off I ended up working from midnight to 4:30 am because my best friend at work pulled a no-show no-call... he showed up at 4 seems he and his girlfriend were fighting all day and he took off too mad to think about coming to work... hmmm... he'd better grow out of that maybe take some anger management classes and maybe get rid of the girlfriend if she's gonna be that much trouble...just because two people have a child together doesn't mean they were meant to be together forever...
37,This place is wearing on me like it did growing up here.
37,Why can't I just learn to say no Last night at work a guy came in I hadn't seen in a while.
37,I have a habit of constantly heading down dead-end roads that I KNOW are dead ends.
25,Even though I am exhausted after today I must get in my rant to get a good night's sleep.
25,Today Travis and I went out to run a few errands and have a nibble afterwards.
25,Because I fear The Wraith and Hoggle equally as much it will probably be a while before a young fellow called Kristensen will hear about my joining the blogging world.
15,'PAinkiller' The past is like a gaping hole No matter how hard you try to run from it You just find that you are running in circles You think of the cause and effect Every action you have made The scar which the past had inflicted cannot be healed Like a wounded bird trapped in a cage You realize that the same mistakes being made Your conscience hunted you You start to doubt yourself Asking yourself the same questions over and over again You felt weak No longer the will to walk on Prayers to god was a momentarily salvation But never was it a cure Painkillers ease but not your pain As you see your love ones One by one Vanishing into the darkness When you tried to grasp and treasure them They were all gone Your eyes were hollow empty without life When you tried to love another Mistakes were repeated Sorrows and misery embedded Deepened and worsened
15,A cup filled with the rainbow of colours Each signify a different meaning Some surfaced to simplicity others hid deep meanings Colours varied in different forms When blue might appear blue Often it does not I was a boy A simple boy My appearance my shell My face my mask My heart is so disguise I fear so much to reveal my true self Will others shy from me Will the people who care for me leave Will I be alone So many questionsso many answers I need to know Fatigue washed over me like a tidal wave Maintaining the cloak sapped my strength The weight of the world weigh down upon me Nothing seems to aid Still I have to carry on Battling against an unseen enemy
15,Time past like a dragging cart I studied the sea of sweaty faces Some delighted in mirth Others solemn and distant While I struggled with my apparent task The weight of the rifle seems to drag me down Blood flowed from cuts Pain and fatigue weakened my determined mind I lick the dry skin of my lips My feet turn from flesh to lead My mind and eyes wandered As sun faded out of view The day ended The weight of responsibilities and rules lifted from my shoulders A young primary student walk past me Reminding me how fortunate they were But still they have to face the inevitable weight of responsibilities And the winding paths of failures
15,“We must not fail our duty let us ride on” Lysandros barked a command as he spurred his steed onwards.
15,The young elf ducked as a blade shimmered past at the same time lashing out and hamstringing his brutish foe.
15,Friends are like ships Anchored their lines by the harbor Each secrete their own goods Revealing only the hull Whether they bring wealth or disasters Cannot be foretold Some anchored for long others drift into the vast empty seas Some grow stale and become constant companions
15,I looked upon the world A pulsing light Growing every minute Daring and brave was I I challenge its unknown might Blood was spilled Tainted the lands A new champion arises Such was its might I was imprisoned Chained to the bounds of eternity Strength and life was drained from me The brightness in my eye flickered and faded Sorrows and agony clenched my heart Fatigue was my constant companion Memories and nightmares haunted me The aura of it presence tremble me every moment Flesh rot and hang from my whitish limbs The seductive allure of hell draws me towards it Writing the last sentence of my life I watched my life flashed before me Like a rat was I Staring at the unassailable titan Witnessing my blade turning to dust My armor my faith swept away with the currents My shield my honor is what I have left Crows and vultures flew the skies covering the sun to an eclipse Jokers and minstrels both sang and mock at my foolishness Perusing his poems And studying mine Looking down at my own demise Drowned my heart and soul
15,'Splinters Love' Dawn of the sun Is the end of night The end of summer Is the onlslaught of winter So many times When you love someone Even loving was painful When the love was broken So much does the splinters of love hurt the heart The birth of love Is the dawn of joy And the end of love Is the renewal of pain
15,'The puppet' His eyes sparkled A smile brightened his face He danced in the lucid night Twirling and spinning He sang songs equal of a bard Graceful was his movements and his soul and body became one Kings and queens were dazzled by his arts Servants and slaves paused in awe Time drags on And kings yawned Time and his mind became mine Strings attached Snapped and torned His purpose was fulfilled And so he was to end A smile faded his off his face
15,'The deer' Eyes darted Ears perked Shuffling sound of dead leaves Fingers of the frigid wind caressed the innocent soul Muscles and sinews tensed Watchful eyes watched its prey And wolves howl in triumphant Dark clouds shrouded the moon Shadows danced back and forth Signalling the end
15,There have been times in my life when I have felt helpless.It is perhaps the most acute pain a person can know founded in frustration andand ventless rage.The nick of sword upon a battling soldier's arm cannot compare to the anguish a prisoner feels at the crack of a whip.
15,'Five for fighting' Song I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find The better part of me I'm more than a bird I'm more than a plane I'm more than some pretty face beside a train And it's not easy to be me I wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie 'Bout a home I'll never see It may sound absurd But don't be naive Even heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed But won't you concede Even heroes have the right to dream And it's not easy to be me Up up and away away from me Well it's alright You can all sleep sound tonight I'm not crazy or anything I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive Men weren't meant to ride With clouds between their knees I'm only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street I'm only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me inside of me Inside of me yeah inside of me inside of me I'm only a man in a funny red sheet I'm only a man looking for a dream I'm only a man in a funny red sheet And it's not easy… It's not easy to be me
15,'The hierachical order' Blades tore skies apart Lightning splits the wounded bird Silent winds swept the lands asunder Angry clouds darkened the skies Scythe of reapers plough the cities Lucid dreams haunted in forms of echoing shadows Treachery spoke louder than compassion Every corner was a silent dagger And a coup practiced neater than a courteous bow Even masters contorted in fear While slaves waited for the darkness to descend Shadows rise and fall unendingly
15,Unsurprisingly it is the 14 of june.
15,'Knowledge' Pages withered wise and old Pages flipped dust fluttered high and low Worn and tattered hid its view from common man Centuries flickered in the light of words The wise wrote its course And the lesser ones seek its enchantment
15,'Truth of reality' As I sat on the sun set hill How the scenery seems mundane compared to you Looking into your enchanting eyes The presence of you gladdens my heart And your words sweeten my soul Time stopped parallel to space Holding your warm hands seeped the strands of love You are the one Who I’m willing to sacrifice for upon the altar of love To brave through the flames of hell To don the shinning armor and be your knight To hear your sorrows and despairs To understand and love you But when the dawn of reality shines upon me How I realize This was all an elusive dream There is no everlasting love No true love Every lie renders me apart Leaving me torn and tattered in an inevitable demise Dark devils fed my soul And men mocked my foolishness Winter now prey upon the land Leaving it bare and dead Life faded into the whispering wind

15,'Power of love' They say angels birth from hell And devils warp from heaven No one knew the truth When time fled into space And space into time None shelter it with concern When love seeks to blind the heart of the lonely one None forsee its path As the blinding of love unbind it self The legends of knights in shinning armor reincarnated The soul of saints rebirth And the blessing of the gods shone once again Such awe and splendour Hidden in the seed of love itself
15,'Flashes of life' The winds blew the memories of the dead The past flashes like a train Emotions swelled to pain sadness and joy Familiar faces carved into the graves Something emerged triumphant The icy cold swept up in a torrent devouring the warm and lush air Like a man frozen with no feelings thoughts nor love
15,They say there is nothing we cannot overcome in life What of times when steel of determination were cut open by the blade of love Fallen so many times to dark pits Hurt torn and shattered.
15,It was her face which etched clearly in my mind
15,Love present past and the future Where art thou I left my dreams and hopes As the light shimmer of memories To a new land I am there Smashing the mirror I knew there was no way back Ruins of past and present lay before me Am i to find the one who i love and who love me not in the midst of the sunless lands Where the wind seems an absent vacuum And the air tainted with death My home I do not know There seems not a presence of a smoke nor shadow AS i tread lifeless waste I found a charcoal sheet Upon it wrote ' July 2 Year 3210 '
15,Love never dies a natural death.
15,There were so many times When i look into her eyes but yet she shun them from me So many times Is there an end I knew i must leave But where Perhaps somewhere where I can find love and care or perhaps a dark corner where i can cry alone I do not know..
15,Fatigue reverberate though the ear Deep lines of wrinkles carved in depth Dark lines embedded by the eyes Pensive thoughts swam in the hollow pool Influx of memories flooded like streams of river Yet tainted and impure it was Strands of white brushed softly against the wind And eyes faded to dark thoughts Where death stalks in the shadow Wisdom and knowledge dwindled into the vast ocean
15,Standing by the window Watching the bright stars shine their light Seeing her face in my mind Listening to the song of the nightingale Feeling the soft caress of the wind Dwelling in solitude -- Pieces of puzzle Fixed on piece by piece I knew so many answers Yet I fear to face them -- Call me a liar a fool But I hear not of them If there was a chance to spin the wheels of time To reach the tunnel of past and present To staunch wound which bleed in my heart -- I would still say

17,i have found the secret to shooting much lower scores in golf: play the womens tees dont laugh...today i tipped it out on the front 9. i hit the ball pretty well but my wedges were going everywhere except where they were supposed to.
17,since i have not been blogging for very long you have not realized everything that has gone into my efforts to break 80 on 18 holes over the past 2+ years since i broke 90. today all of those struggles finally came to fruition as i made about a 5 footer for a 78 on the last hole.
17,yes it has been awhile since i posted as i was occupied with actually doing things with people and escorting ryan (my friend who as he puts it is from florida but happens to live in kentucky) around town...there might be something to this social stuff...i will attempt to make up for this with renewed vigor or not.
14,Well ok I used to play tennis at this clay court here in Singapore.
14,Today at school was a huge mess up.
14,Being in my class as I realized today is like playing a huge game of Survivor.
14,Ok there's this friend in my OM team called Muthusamy.
14,I have something called an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder when it comes to turning off the lights.
14,Ok... Singapore just broadcasted 'World Idol' and I'm wondering why Asians could not vote.
14,Yep I was playing 'The Sims: Superstar' yesterday and I killed 2 people Well I'm getting a little wierd using the example of making a 70 year old couple give birth to 4 kids to tend to the farm Well anyway I was getting jealous at the kids not having to go to school on alternate days without having to see a doctor Well anyway I'm not staying in Boarding School for the next semester and so my dad's going to get a timer fixed in my bloody computer.
14,Well looking at the amount of homework I've got for the June holidays I really shouldn't be calling it the June holidays anymore.
14,Here is my supposed-to-be-unopiniated summary of the 4th leg of the race.
14,Amazing Race's Sports Injury by Ethan Alter The Amazing Race's father-daughter duo Jim and Marsha got off to the roughest start of any team.
14,Ok... That title is entirely random and hysterical.
14,This to me was the best episode yet With the dating couples ending their losing streak and a proper fun Roadblock and an even choice for Detour.
14,I'm still wondering why I have so much to blog about this week...
14,I just peeked into my sister's blog actually delved into it.
14,Yes the 'programme' I was referring to is the CIP I had on Thursday at Macritchie Reserve.
14,Here are the actual highlights of this leg not my opinion The first thing the teams did when thet arrived in Uruguay was to find this hand on a beach.
14,Amazing Race Definitely I don't see why CBS hesitated so much about bringing this season back cause from the first episode I can totally tell this season's going to be absolutely awesome My comments on the teams... Well sorry they're up so bloody late my sis's been hogging the com Alison & Donny -- Everybody hates me nobody likes me I thought that Alison would come in with that mentality but no only her little Donny is upset with her or so she thinks.
14,Yes yes... By the time you read this I expect you to know the Greeks won Euro 2004.
14,Haha Today was my group's Youth Day presentation and I tell you...
14,Recently blogging has been all the trend and on the papers it's been pretty publicised.
14,Yes I told you that all the animal titles would be my comments on the teams.
14,Anyone see dead mummies this episode.
14,By Ethan Alter There's one thing you can say for sure about Bob and Joyce: These senior citizens definitely don't look like your typical Internet-dating couple.
14,Can you believe it I actually went to Geylang yesterday cause my dad wanted to try something new and there was like the supposed food haven.
14,If you ever see a random title it's my opinions of the teams on each leg of the race.

23,HiHi Basically I have to write something because I have been soooo darned lazy these past few months and my friend emailed me to say she'd be checking (how boring Sorry Charmaine) She just told me she wouldn't be back for another 18 months which I suspected because I think that London might be a little like KL it sounds really fun and a lot of people that go there spend a longer time there than they thought they would.. my unlce spent 12 yrs there and he was supposed to study only Plus its good money and travel prospects everything being so close and all.

25,Woohoo - she'll be here tomorrow - which probably means I need to clean the place up a bit - uh oh :( Since Jen's going to get a car we'll be able to at least grab some furniture so she'll have somewhere to sit - and she has timed it perfectly for the pool opening on the weekend.
25,That's right this is the week Jen arrives on Thursday and will be staying right through to the following Sunday - Yay :) Also on the good news front I now have Cable TV Broadband and a new mattress.
25,I'll be getting bot a new mattress and cable TV/Cable internet on Saturday.
25,My stuff from Ireland arrived this morning - so I now have all my CD's DVD's clothes etc.
25,I've decided to document my little adventure in America.
25,Not so much from the what happened point of view as from the 'thank God it's over' point of view.
25,Well now that things are settling down a bit I find I have a bit of spare time on my hands.
25,Woohoo - I got my learners permit This time I got every question right though if I'd had this test last time I would have had no trouble then either - just the luck of the draw I guess..... Now all I have to do is learn how to drive before my car arrives next month :) Yesterday was a pretty good day all round in fact - as well as the successful test the Pistons destroyed the Lakers.
25,Just realised I never mentioned the new chair - My Lazboy arrived on Saturday and I'm glad tosay it rocks :) On the bad side of things - I managed to fail the theory test on the Virginia drivers license exam so I have to re-take it tomorrow........grrrr What's annoying is that I needed 20 correct out of 25 and I got 19 - the last question was how much more likely you are to have an accident if you are drunk - 5 times 7 times 10 times or 12 times.
25,Finally got around to installing linux (fedora core2) on the laptop - it is working quite well I even have wireless networking going on it using the Netgear WG511 card I bought a while back - Nice :) Also have the bare bones for 2 new systems - one dual PIII 1Ghz and one dual PIII 866.
25,Jen left last night and it was 10 times worse than when we said goodbye back in the Old Country - at least then I had all the excitement of going to a new job a new country a new apartment etc.
25,My apartment now looks like someone actually lives there my DVD's CD's and books are up off the floor though not arranged in any meaningful order yet ;) As soon as the desk arrives (should be tomorrow) I'll post some decent pictures of the whole thing.
25,Unfortunately it sems that my webhosting company has gone tits up.
25,OK I knew that the whole Atkins diet low carb thing was big in the US but I was still surprised when I got here at how pervasive the whole thing is.
25,Decided it was time to flex my coding muscles this week so I've put together a little tool that converts IP Addresses URL's and Host names into Autonomous System numbers and gives a few other little tidbits while it's at it too.
25,Went to see Spiderman 2 last night - have to say that I liked it - didn't have the fun of the first one when you were learning how they were going to implement all the superpowers and stuff but still good none the less.
25,The site has been down/slow for the last couple of day - no idea why and I'm too lazy to find out.
25,I got a letter yesterday from Audi Financial saying my credit application had been turned down.
25,Picked up the new car yesterday - I still can't drive it without a licensed driver in the car too but that should all be rectified soon enough.
17,I cant believe that im actually making another online journal/diary thing.
17,What a shitty 4th of July.
17,So today was pretty damn uneventful.
17,GOD DAMN IT This is another major reason why I hate writing online.
26,I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day.
26,my wife just walked in and placed a big bag of pistachios on the table next to me... they are nice.
26,Negative energy don't we all have some of this within I would think we would have to considering all of it that surrounds us.
26,I would like to start out with a little explanation as to who I am and why I have created this little corner of my world.
15,One of my favorite topics..Its there cuz I had always been intrigued with it...And the intrigue ceased when I decided to try it out..But it wasn't for fun...I just felt bad....Felt alone...Desperate..
15,Death-..Once again on my mind that simple desire for something that only time can bring...Or maybe that accident I've always dreamed of...To die doing something I love...Or just walking down the street...Alone...As always...Just to die now...Alone...All alone leaving nothing behind..No one to cry for my death..My disappearance...For the way I just left for my own will...I had gone because I wanted to...I really do..I wish it would be as easy as it seems...I mean..Its just dying..I actually don't care where I'll go after death..It doesn't matter where my destiny shall take me when I'm gone..As long as I was gone....As for what I believe...Anything is better than being alive and having to be right here...Right now....As if there was anything left for me in this world...Anything worth my time..Anything worth living...Anything worth that so called 'limited time' God.. (as if he was real jajaja) gives people is just shit...At least for me it is...If anyone could ever want it..Hey its yours...Its not like I'm gonna use it in anything better...I feel as if I didn't need it...As if there was no use in having to live...Living was just meaningless...I was..And am gonna die anyways...So why not just do it now.....Why live anything more.Some say life toughens you by experience...Bad experience...But I don't want to get any tougher...No more experiences...No more suffering....No more life...Please I beg you...Take this away from me....Take my life where I cant ever find it again..Take it somewhere else...Hide it....Disappear it....Make it fade away...Put it in a box...Lock it away...Lock everything I once had away...Feelings..Memories...Thoughts....Wishes...Dreams...Take it all away...I don't want it in me anymore...I just want emptiness...I want to feel nothing..At all...Just to be empty inside...So that I don't have to go through anything that could harm me...Ever again...Just to be hole...Empty.....Useless....
15,“There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is only the comparison of one state with another.
15,There she was..Standing there in the middle of the night..All tied up inside because of her problems...No where to go...No one to save her from what she was becoming....Losing her self in the atmosphere...Loosing her self in no ones dreams...Loosing her self in between....Lost...Trying to find her way...Getting nowhere...Trying to find a place...A spot to stop hiding...Start facing what was going on in her life...To start realizing NOTHING was alright...And it was never going to be...Not ever....Never again..To realize..That she had lost it all...
15,'I walk down the face of this Earth alone.
15,There I stood..In that dark cold night...Staring right into those eyes who had been watching me as I walked through that dark...Endless forest....Those eyes that had watched me...That had followed me..All the way through the forest....Then I got lost...That's the only reason I saw the eyes on the first place..I felt watched ever since I entered the forest....But I didn't want to look back...So I just went on...But now...I was lost...I got lost and looked all around...But I stopped in the eyes...Dark eyes...I could only see some little shine on the...But no color...Just shine..And I was freaked...I looked into those eyes..But wasn't scared at all...Those eyes seemed to be admiring me...Meant no harm...But as I looked at them they drank my essence..I didn't feel anything..I just felt tired...But I wasn't tired...I was just dying...Slowly...Maybe too slow to notice what was happening...To really know that I wasn't ok..That my life...My essence was taken away from me...Because I got lost and looked into those eyes...Then I died...After hours of staring...I died...Those eyes took all my Essence...They took my soul...They took all that made me...Well...Me...
15,I said I had enough...Of you...Of the world..Of everything..Of existence...Of life...It's senseless to be fed up and still have to be..Please something kill me....Now...
15,Never thought I would end up here...Where I was...Lost stranded...But happy....It's that kind of happiness that simply exists and is there for no apparent reason...That happiness that becomes confusing after a while...It's great being happy....But that day it was stranger than ever before..I was happy...Yeah great but then again it had no explanation.-...And I wasn't just happy like any other time that happened...I felt stupid....I laughed at everything and it all seemed great....What the hell was happening to me....I mean not only the happiness...That almost never happened...WHY...I mean not only that there was no reason...But that even though I was happy it didn't feel good...But the day went on...As for my conscious side..It went to sleep.....Then I woke up on this room with cushioned walls....What the hell had happened last night....Why was I in a mental hospital....What did I have a straightjacket on...What had I done...What the hell was wrong with me... Then the doctor came in...He told me I had been killing people...But that I wasn't just killing them...He said I danced with them...Told them how happy They should feel to finally understand the meaning of life....That they should be as happy as me...Then I understood...All those days I had felt happy I had woken up in a police station acussed of inappropriate behavior towards other people..I was hurting them...Trying to take their lives away...But I couldn't...Until today...The day I realized that happiness just wasn't meant for me..It wasn't meant to be..I'd prefer being condemned to a life in depression than a minute of happiness in which I ended up killing people...Taking their lives was what made me happy...Keeping them...Even more...But being stuck in that white cushioned room took all the happiness away cuz when insane...It's better to just do what your mind tells you...cuz if u don't...Things get worse...
15,Reach out..Find air...That's all that went through mi mind at the time...I felt tired...Had no air....Needed some air...To breathe...To live on to continue with this torturing existence...To live on in this pathetic side of the world...The only reason I had was you...And you in my mind always..I had to get over the place I was forced to live in...I had to become someone...Be something to get to you...To reach you....To finally get to be with you....To know myself...Cuz I find myself in you...
15,I never thought that I wouldn't hurt...I really thought it would...For life....But it just didn't....I thought the pain I was about to feel would change what I was..For ever...But it didn't....The pain of the knife the pain of death the pain of suicide...None of that's real...There's no pain at all...Watch as my life fades away from me....Watch me as I stand there...Bleeding....Bleeding like I never had before...The life that I had once had was fading away...Leaving my side...And it was through the blood....That life went away....From me...
15,Alone..Living by myself living in a world made for those 'sociable' ....Those considered normal...Common....But not for me....I turned out wrong...I went the wrong way around...I'm not a good part of society....Cuz I don't feel like part of any kind of society..Only my own...Not because I'm a bad person or anything like that....What happens is I'm not the same as everyone else...I've got my issues..My stuff..My things that make me feel good..But that seem weird for the rest of the people..I'm in my own little world....Living by myself..But still I'm happy....Cuz I don't have to be like everybody else to be happy..I just have to be me...
15,Time stood still as I tried to trace my way in the fog..I've never been so lost..I've been trying to find my way for so long..But now I guess where I am is where I'm supposed to be..This must be home..I was home all along..But home doesn't feel good..It feels..Well...Kinda lost actually..I'm stuck in this war between what I am..And what I want to be..And what I want to be just doesn't make me feel better..So it's awkward..But its where I am and what I am..So that's just it..Good or bad....Who cares its just me..
15,..There I Stood In Front Of My Fears..Facing Them..Trying To Overcome Them..But It Was Just To Much To Take..The Lights Faded Away..And So Did I..
15,actually I'm not entirely dead..Well my body is alive..But I'm not...My soul died..Very long ago...Ever since...Well it's too long to remember..I believe people see me alive 'cuz its like a burden a have to go trough..Day in day out of having to be in this fuked up place..Having to exist...It sucks ass..Who cares if my language is inappropriate ..You'd say the same if you had to live here...Believe me you would...There's nothing nice...Nothing good about it...To have to go through this...Everyday...I wish I could die entirely..But I cant..I just exist because I have to..There's nothing more to it..And I wish there was just nothing..At all...No existence no living...Not having to be..
15,...No sense in living..Life has no meaning..But death can't be controlled by the human hand..So..
15,I'm cold..Freezing..Lost..Fading away..Feeling alone..Left out..Desperate..It feels bad..But not bad enough to look for you...I'd rather live a life alone than spend 10 minutes with you..I'd rather talk to myself..Invent people...Have imaginary friends..Anything is better than you..I hate you..I wish you had never existed..Never had come into my life to ruin it..I wish I had never been your FRIEND..cuz I was a true one..You were just like any other hypocrite..Trying to get things out from me trying to know my secrets to then make them public..Betray me like any other bitch..But who cares....I'm better off without you..And I'm glad to realize what you are..I hate you..Very very much..Please die..You should..Just keep it in mind.. 'later..
15,Life..Death..//..Somewhere in between..that place where you see those you loved in life..but don't seem to be able to get close to them...to have any kind of contact..you see them...you feel them..but they don't..they believe you're dead..and you are..but it doesn't feel like death...you don't even know how death actually feels like because you had things in the world of the living that you didn't do..that's why you're there...stuck in the middle..no sense in trying to go back...cuz there's no way back...
15,Looking 4 a place...searching 4 a soul....to be just like mine...to like the same things I do...looking 4 you...to come and save me...to take me away from where I now am..to save my soul from me...from what I've become..from THIS....what I am....to take me away from where there's no way back..from where I cant escape..but now...I can't seem to find you..you're not here..and I can't search no more...I'm tired...exhausted of trying to find the one that will never come..now I realize I'm alone...left in pain..left in sorrow..left somewhere in between what is usually called Good and Evil ...left in a place where I have to decide where I wish to go..but I don't even know what I want....what I wish for..where to go...left or right..'good or bad'...I cant decide...but being where I am isn't better..and I cant decide..
15,So..then again why am I ten feet under..
15,Death..My perfect state...That simple point where reality is a dream...A nightmare once lived...A simple memory that comes back to torment our soul...A place where no one wants to go back to...A point where everything seems worse that it is..Everything makes sense and it all sucks...You stand in a point in which everything you do has a consequence...Everything takes you somewhere else..Somewhere worse than before...All of this shit that doesn't exist when Dead...Death is a rest...A simple lay back...Plain relaxation....A stage in which there is nothing..At all....An empty play..No actors..No actresses...Not even a back stage crew...Simple emptiness...No feelings...No dreams...No memories...No LIFE...
15,Everything's lost...Everything fades.....You have nothing...And you wish to go back....But hey....There's no way back.. ¬|WELCOME|¬ ...you've reached the point of no return....You and you mistakes are here..Nothing good lies in between these walls...Everything that once tormented you is here....Just to make your life miserable...Here in the point of no return you live as if life was a simple burden...Nothing is good...And for some nothing's changed...Life is a burden...And it will ALWAYS be...If you don't stop running.......So STOP....Face everything you've done...Every mistake you've made..All of those things you've tried you run away from will haunt you if you don't stop running and start facing....Life isn't milk and cookies...And it'll never be..So it all depends on what you do..To continue running or start being YOU...
15,My mind got lost.......Last thing I remember...I was stuck in a hospital.....I think someone stabbed me....cuz there was a lot of blood...I woke up on a bed...I had been unconscious for quite long...According to what the nurse said....Still I can remember some parts of the surgery....All that blood...All my blood there..On the floor..On the perfect white sheets....On my friends' shirts...On the doctors cloak...There was blood everywhere.....That delicious dead-like smell....Blood mixed with some alcohol......Everyone's so nervous....All the doctors saying were loosing her.....Fuck she's leaving....All the nurses giving things to the doctor...Helping him....All of them saying....Pressure level is too low.....We need more blood....And some other injections....I cant remember very well....Then..Everything was black again..I fell unconscious.....Miraculously I woke up....I saw the nurse.....Asked her for a piece of paper...And some water.....She said I couldn't have either of them.....I tried to ask why...But the words didn't come out.....Everything turned black again...And light never came into my eyes again.....I was dead...

23,I much prefer that opening to Lucas's 'A long time ago in a galaxy far far away' but I have to admit that one of my favorite parts of a very funny speech a friend of mine used to give revolves around the fact that although Star Wars is futuristic it's supposed to have happened in the past.

14,Hi everyone I'm new in here... Just wanna say Helloo
35,In an earlier post Johnathan said: 'And then: What of Gregory Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun patrolling the darkness that lurks therein ........
35,I'd post this on the RTG Blog but I can't post there.
35,The answer to the first question lies with Master Po; the answer to the second is Sister Jayna the priestess who took over after Castillion departed.
35,it seems odd to think of brother ian as having a father.
35,since our next game is the weekend of halloween why don't we all dress up like our characters next session
35,- Hillsfar ruled by Lord Malthiir believed by the party to be a former gang/crime lord who came to power by unknown means.
35,perhaps we can have it that if an email is sent out that a confirmation email can be sent back.
35,Mir -- Ben said something about 50/50.
35,I don't know how long RTG will last.
35,and as far as characters go i like luc - i want to see where her story goes - i've committed over 2 years to seeing how she would develop and i want to see the ending.
35,and i don't even believe that duellacathata is actually dead.
35,To be fair Duellacathata didn't directly frame the party; that was (supposedly) the desire of K'Sh'Aal (or rather his/her/its representative).
35,i'm going to stick with Ian for now.
35,Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian) the group will be at an interesting crux: What Next The party is now international in membership and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.
35,Referring to Johnathan's post I think that the party clearly does not have the same goals.
35,[ Mon Oct 06 05:44:17 PM | hot chocolate ] oh burne how i miss thee and thine control over ye big mouthed monk.
35,To paraphrase JMS of B5 fame one might consider this the story of a platoon in WWII.
35,dude i have no idea where that notebook is now but i get your point.
35,[ Mon Oct 06 12:11:48 PM | hot chocolate ] and the cast still remaining from the first season are: Scott Moran (Gregory) Miriam Maddux (Luc) Ben Haley (Brother Ian) Jimi Harrell (Rhanellus) the scoobys and of course the god of us all Johnathan Shipley.
35,Perhaps you can make notes to yourself during the game as John did.
35,very interesting but hard to keep in head all at once.
35,Hey folks -- check your email No game today.
35,i will be there for the entire game this week.
35,Even funnier if you replace the guys with a drow a beholder and an illithid.
35,joke moved to circle of irony err...actually not.
35,i will be at the next game
35,The road to glory is currently a quiet one it seems.
35,Hey You buckle your swashes someplace else pal This is a family friendly joint
35,man that was like one of the best games ever....
35,this is what i also look for in relationships: No More Messy 'Inky' Towels and Hands Easy Break Down and Assembly Customizing Evolving Map Standard One Inch (1') Grids

35,...but the spirit of the fellowship remains so long as we hold true to the purpose of the one we sought and found.
35,Having acquired the proof needed to clear themselves of the murder charge the party accepted an offer from the shadowy K'Sh'Aal to eliminate the would-be crimelord who framed the party.
35,yeah i don't know why people don't go to this site -
35,Even the crickets have stopped chirping....
35,yuggoth - fungi demon lord starting to invade higher reaches of underdark.
35,in case anyone wishes to know i did get accepted into the english grad program.
35,in response to ben's journal entry - even though what we are doing may have no real significance and no will ever know the actions we will perform this day it is still important that we do them.
35,this article discusses the american support of and the merits of torture used on political detainees.
35,The poet is in command of his fantasy while it is exactly the mark of the neurotic that he is possessed by his fantasy.
35,it's odd and sad - mary magdalene is here but where are peter and judas
35,nobody reads this damn thing anyway so i'll attempt to be poetic (and also because johnathan challenged me once long ago about knowing the meaning of love).
35,figured it out - hee hee.
35,hmm.. when i refresh the site the new messages come up - okay time to stop hitting the bong...
35,les in order for your post to be on the site you need to hit post&publish....

35,So how does this damn thing work anyway
35,It's been over 90 degrees the past two days in the big apple.
35,a great headline - and yes it is from one of those liberal rags that i read if you don't get it (the headline) pls write your name address and phone number on a postcard tie your arms and legs together and throw yourself into the ocean... 'Work to Salvage Racism Conference'
35,welcome mark no as ms. tree has already addressed i am not in NYC.
35,you guys have got to love this article - he not only says lucas has no talent that star wars is a bunch of rubbish but also that joseph campbell just sounds erudite but is really a gas bag.
35,i'm going to move in with you tree.
35,No Mark Tree lives in NYC.
35,Ben does this mean that you're now living in New York I never seem to hear about anything that happens on the east coast anymore.
35,wasn't it just 70 degrees in NY It must be so exciting to live up there - with all the culture...
35,me again with more advice on happy blogging.
35,hello group - now that i'm starting to get the hang of writing HTML please post any suggestions you might have about the look of the site - things like font size color etc.
35,[4/5/2002 5:51:57 PM | miriam maddux] okay okay.
35,welcome chummers to the new and improved circle of irony .
35,you've come a long way baby 'Before all of this happened I was extremely interested in posing' Silvas said in an interview posted on the Playboy Web site.
35,Speaking of Russia what in the world is going on here Russia became a junior member of NATO recently (like 2 days ago).
35,in response to the russian article - every religion has it's beginnings somewhere and who knows we can be looking at the beginning of another christ cult.
35,I am going off of other people's words here but supposedly the Ep II novel discusses spirits (for lack of a better word).
35,'Sergei Torop was a traffic cop in the small Russian town of Minusinsk until 1989 when he announced that he was the son of God.
35,i think you may be putting much more thought into your analysis of the movie than was actually put into the script for attack of the clones or phantom menace.
35,something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: 'disappearing' vs. 'leaving a corpse' at the death of a jedi.
35,the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members: shannon erwin and johnathan 'better-late-than-never' shipley.
35,allright shannon who is edward jones does he have a good job is he nice to pets and children you haven't seen episodeII are you sick
35,I have not seen Episode II yet so cannot actively participate in the current thread but I just wanted to let everyone know that I am present and accounted for and thanks to Ben for inviting me back into the sandbox.
35,the whole thing was a dupe engineered by palpatine/sideous to take control of the republic with a now tried-and-true army to back up said control.
35,Too many unanswered questions that I don't think will be answered in Episode III: 1) Who was Jango working for On one side he was the basis for the clones.
35,so what did everyone think of the starwars movie
35,check out ben's picture on the sbac site (i believe it is called art damnit under the links - he's in the tobacco gallery section - probably only up for a few more days and he has hair
35,an argument for absolutes in what seems to be a subjective universe - in order for certain mechanisms to work they must have an order - there is a specific way it must be done or it will not work.
35,well folks you won't get any commentary from me for the next few days - i'm going on a trip - on a plane.
35,i love that smile you can enter the secret city (if ben has not already told you over his cube wall) is to go to the main site - and there are listings of other places you can go - links - the last link is a link to the secret city which i assume is a type of journal.

27,We have now returned to the days of subsidized sodas.
27,Alright if anyone can help me with the formatting of this thing (My programming IQ is that of a mongoloid troglodyte) - I'm uber-unhappy with how this looks and the 5 blogger skins I have to choose from are a further affront to my senses.

27,Via: Mango Hi to you too honey From everyone in Network Services you just mailed this to ... (notice the '000' address you send this email to).
27,Not that we needed a graph to figure this out but this map helps show YoY gains.
27,Why the fuck did he just call what we're doing in Iraq an 'occupation' Did anyone else catch that...
27,Ever have one of those days where you set your Media Player to 'random' and let it run through your ENTIRE music selection (in my case about 1100 songs) - and for its' life it can't come up with ONE.GOOD.SONG Well that is my day and it's thoroughly pissing me off.
27,What the... Not sure that this is real but it was fwd'd to me earlier today.
27,Well not really but I went out today with my boss and a buddy from Santa Monica.
27,This from a girl I know's Xanga - apparently she's interviewing out @ Tufts and is having a tough time adjusting to Boston.
27,Well Im not going to copy the entire damn thing (It's big) but I got an email where you select your b-day from the list and it bops you down to your horoscope thing (sort of).
27,Yes even from here my long arm of power can reach you :)
27,And OMG one word for the trip: EPIC - I'll even have the scars to remember it by.
27,For those of you who didn't already know I ride a motorcycle an R6 specifically.
27,So in case anyone is wondering wtf this post is about I'm about || 1) Not piss off the moderators with my political rants which usually denigrate my witting victim 2) Direct some more traffic here - our political insult-fests (on average) get more hits/posts than anything in those sections.
27,And maybe this can help explain how furious I get when a liberal opens their stupid ass retarded mouth some choice quotes from the R6MessageNet - a motorcycle messageboard I frequent: This first one's about the Marine who recently received the Navy Cross that nobody heard about on the news: I read the citation above in the story and just wondered if the guy runs for president as a democrat in 30 years or so will the citation be questioned along with whether he really did kill as many enemy as suggested etc.
27,Expect daily changes to this thing - the one part I'm really bummed about is how 'skinny' the text portion is - however if you take a peek at the code you'll see how each 'layer' has been individually sized which means (as far as I can tell) each box needs to individually be re-sized (oof).
27,Some key excerpts from the WaPo article from earlier today: The rally lacked the star power and certainly the numbers of the first Million Mom March in 2000 when hundreds of thousands of women flooded the Mall on Mother's Day.
27,This is COMPLETELY blowing up I see no less than 15 articles on drudge referring to this crap today.
27,Firstly let me say that Michael Moore is a waste of oxygen who needs to have his breathing-privileges permanently fuckin' revoked for constantly churning-out 4-plus-hour pieces of self-indulgent garbage and allowing hoardes of mindless bastards with room-temperature IQs to call him 'visionary' and 'gifted' and all the other fuckin' mindless platitudes they reserve for only the most TALENTLESS cunts in the Director-game nowadays Michael Moore suffers from a sadly non-fatal disease called A.N.T.S (Absolutely No Talent Syndrome) and watching his movies is less stimulating than intravenous valium and almost as unpleasant as watching naked 70-year-old homosexuals fuck.
27,In today's day and age with the internet permeating our lives we are exposed to some pretty shocking shit - whether it be goatse or tubgirl or just some crazy stuff going on around the world we get it from all sides.
27,I'd posted this 'bulletin' (below) in response to one whore who just kept posting 'GO SEE F911' like 50 times a day.
27,Realizing that I just spent way to much time putting together a list of links de-bunking MM's political fiction movie released this weekend to not share it with you.
27,And why is it when you See JK on campaign stops on his right is the man he saved from drowning in Veitnam and on his left is Ted Kennedy This shit is really confusing me.
27,'We're just workin till the day we decide we've had enough' -Against Me 'Jordan's first choice' Against Me is a super-liberal punk band that I kind of put up with b/c I like their energy the guys voice is pretty cool and they make fun of liberals (they're anarchists).

27,I dont know what's better gettin laid or gettin paid I just know when I'm gettin one the other's gettin away... -Dilated Peoples 'This way' I'm at work.
27,Spent about 2 hours yesterday trying to fix the elevator in my buddy's house.
27,Sure to break both my legs my back my neck some fingers and my ear...
27,Is it just me or did these things go out of style 2 years ago If so why would two supposed 'hipsters' (my gay boss and our DJ analyst) give me a funny look when I made fun of my boss for wearing one.
27,Yes a re-post but worth it.
27,Tentatively planned for late August if not the first week in September.
27,Remember when the coups in Venezuela were 'big events' as little as a year ago Chavez (the socialist dictator) pretty much nationalized everything in the country from media companies to oil production etc.
27,I question the timing of these arrests.
27,Yes I know blogging's been light lately typical work load for a 'team' at work here is 3-5 deals just found out we have 14 in process.
27,The blast doesn't travel at the speed of light but the light from the blast does.

36,well it's been a disappointing week all around.
36,I'm not sure what's derailed my day more.
36,I've been playing with the colors.
36,I'm blogging today because it says in my planner that today I blog.
16,True Crime The Streets of LA First I have to say I didn't enjoy the graphic really It's definitly Boring The designes of streets and the way the cars crash or explode is not so graphically good.

15,I don't know who to trust....and right now I have to find a way to realx...yes relax It's not the end of the world... . My life isn't going anywhere...although it has its told on me (the annoyance that you get for wishing you can do everything at once).
15,Everything was good until I have a nap and everything seems like it got from a happy calm place to a war.
15,The lips are so lazy.... it only holds the love within an ehcanting kiss and nothing more.
15,Just when you want everything to stay the way it was...you go back to school ---_--- I even thought that it was too soon for school But sure enough things to do and a lot of things to be finished for tomorrow's plan.
15,Letter from Trowa-Kun that was written on a piece of paper: Dear Trowa-Kun If you don't remember what happened upon this date well it is when you need time alone.Sorry to bring this up but I am only writing to inform you how I feel.
26,Well this is it for me for a while.
26,Four years ago today one of my best friends died.

26,Since graduating from college last year one of the greatest pleasures I have discovered is reading.
26,I've been taking Lupron for seven days now.
26,Today is the official start of IVF/ICSI cycle number one.
26,Well I promised to return with great tales of familial dysfunction and I am as good as my word.
15,Sexual nightmares NIGHTMARE #1 After a long night of making love the young guy rolled over pulled out a cigarette from his jeans and searched for his lighter.
36,Will someone please tell me about the highlights of the VMAs You're killing me here Sorry I can't make it to MN this weekend.
36,Oh one more thing: Panda if you come to MN then I can meet you I'm guessing that will push it right over the top
36,I went to the State Fair last night.
36,Hey Panda... yet another reason why you should consider a last-minute trip to MN - MTV will surely be re-running the big show all weekend long
36,It's nights like tonight that I wish I had cable.
36,I heard that tonight P. Diddy is throwing the greatest party of all time after the MTV Video Awards.
36,Last Christmas Hal gave me a few calendars.
36,Don't even try to pretend you don't love it DJS.
36,American Idol...what the %@# I got suckered into watching the end of it and I so wanted that microphone..er I'm sorry...Justin to go.
36,Whoever said I originally let him go So I never told you all about my brother's wedding.
36,I hurt my back this weekend and have been a gimp ever since.
36,I can't believe I actually clicked on the link to that Rick Astley website .
36,Stoner suggested I open something up to this forum we call Pandyland.
36,I wish we had more efficient public transportation here in Minnesota.
36,I opened up Internet Explorer this morning and what did I see Panda's little brother There's a story about him on our intranet -- apparently he's doing a great job as a business banker.
36,DJ S I extend my sympathies regarding the soda fiasco.
36,Always hard to follow a post about someone blowing chunks but...
36,The horror A friend of mine started her day yesterday not feeling all that well.
36,Hey Panda Have a great time Pass on my best to 'the angry scotsman' and the 'polish picnic'.
36,I will be out tomorrow - going to my little bro's wedding in Milwaukee.
36,I feel so bad for Nikki.
36,OK what the heck just happened First Seacrest makes out with some woman in the crowd then the 'Idols' decide to sing a Paula Abdul medley for Ms. Abdul herself (I've heard chimps sing better) and then Tamyra gets kicked off What about Nikki She needs to have her vocal chords permanently removed as not to cause this nation more pain and suffering.
36,What you posted below is exactly why I love it so... because it's so bad it's embarrassing.
36,I have to admit I'm a closet fan of 'AI' myself.
36,Today I am visiting my nemesis: REI REI and I dont mix.
36,Who ever thought it would be so difficult to find a good non-cheesy DJ for a wedding Billygoat and I were in Wisconsin over the weekend checking out local vendors for our big day.
36,I work for a big company and part of my job is to edit communications pieces.
36,Oh the excitement of working in a suburban office tower.
36,It is also 24-7...and this is not a weekday-only blog my friends.
36,Look I just posted again The freedom has gone to my head.
36,I'm confused - she doesn't like Pandyland She prefers participating in a system where you have to log into email send a message to someone who may or may not preserve its integrity and then wait hours upon hours (or even the entire weekend) for the message to appear Pandyland is real-time and I love it.
36,News flash... Sara some goofy broad on Sasshole visited this here site and claimed it was a joke.
36,Yo yo yo...DJ is in the hizzy for rizzy.
36,Make that two (2) diet cokes.
36,Stoner I am honored by your presence.
36,I am pleased to announce my arrival at Pandyland I am excited about my newfound freedom.
36,I guess I can't seem to avoid trouble lately.
36,I'm so excited and I just can't hide it I'm about to lose control and I think I like it.
36,Forced into exile by the crap called Sasshole I bring you the next big thing on the Net: Pandyland.
36,Sometimes I believe that cheaters prosper.
36,Um...will you knit me a sweater I'm looking for a northeastern cabled fisherman's sweater style sweater (XL - sigh) in forest green.
36,Duf Fer -- you are not sharing too much because I have no idea who those people are.
36,I love my wife she is wonderful but in my nature is a tendency to have absurd crushes.
36,Today was looking pretty grim until just a minute ago.
36,Hey Panda - since you've had some near-misses with Bono around town maybe you'll have more luck with Peter Gabriel.
36,Are they cheesy hash browns I like cheesy hash browns.
36,Ive actually seen Panda do a duet of Up Where We Belong and I have to tell you it was truly inspiring.
36,I think I will sing something inspirational like 'Up Where We Belong' or the theme song from 'The Great American Hero' (Believe it or not I'm walking on air...).
36,HAL to boss: 'Hey Jac-kay baby I got ya money doncha worry Jac-kay.'
36,I just went to Taco Bell with my boss and she tried to pimp me out to a pair of 18 year olds.
36,I would like to sing 'Summer Wine' (the song that is on the 'Corrs Live on VH1' cd apparently Nancy Sinatra sang it) just like they do -- as a duet with Bono.
36,Sign me up for the PBJ (Pandyland Burrito Jamboree).
36,I think that everyone should have to sing a song at the first annual Pandyland Burrito Jamboree.
36,Since I am coming to Minneapolis on the weekend of October 12th I think a Pandyland rendezvous is in order.
36,Ball of confusion That's what the world is today Hey Hey So last night I get home from work thinking there is going to be this great anniversary celebration (what is the second anniversary anyway Tin Paper Cash I think it is cotton or china) and I find my wife drunk on Grain Belt Premium singing that Dave Edmunds song: 'I Knew the Bride When She Used to Rock and Roll' out of key at the top of her lungs.
36,You'll have to ask the 'rents about the open bar plan since that's their gig.
36,I feel like a loser that I wasnt in the short-story contest like everyone else though I had a nice weekend regardless.
36,I haven't been able to post much lately.
36,DJS you are right on the money about craphole.com...not only are their posts ridiculous-o but that idiot Sara thinks our site is the mock site that Mr. Crap had painstakingly made eons ago.
36,I think I might have to wait to post my story on this here site.
36,Shovelpants Stoner participated in the self same short story contest.
36,Not a bad weekend on my end either.
36,I have to say it was a good weekend.
36,I have come up with a new 'workplace friendly' version of the Nelly song: 'Hot in Herrre.'
36,Yeah Bobo was a real 'clown' alright.
36,Okay...reading my TV post I came off as kind of a suckerhead and everyone knows that's not how I do...so.
36,I'm so glad you all voted off Bobo Le Clown.
36,Wow I didn't think I would get such a rebuttal.
36,Okay Panda let me clear the air about the whole TV thing.
36,I just caught a bit of Bono on Oprah this morning.
36,I couldn't watch more than 2 minutes of Fastlane.
36,I have to go to Cleveland...
36,Billygoat comes back from Cleveland today.
36,To all you suckerheads who don't live in Chicago: BONO IS IN TOWN TODAY.
36,Special thanks to Stoner for performing a vigilante rodent inspection earlier this week (she gave us the all-clear).
36,Hey...I got no shame I'd do it.
36,That sounds delightful Even though I never met the Shovel I think I would thoroughly enjoy seeing him get his toenails painted.
36,That's funny -- I was just thinking the Pandyland staff should go out for manis and pedis when Panda is in town.
36,Bright Idea Of The Day: I think our Pandyland blogging staff should meet for a delicious Chipotle burrito someday.
36,I just overheard someone say we had female problems yesterday but then I realized they actually said we had email problems yesterday.
36,Panda - your Bill story is classic and informative.
36,DJS I like to read your Soft Drink site.
36,That story sounds oddly familiar...Billygoat and I thought my silverfish were coming from Bill the guy across the hall from me.
36,For the record our apartment is spotless (except for the peanut butter that is probably now all over the place thanks to our old-fashioned mousetraps).
36,Well while we're on the subject... My girlfriend is a clean-freak.
36,So I was thinking of visiting Hal and Stoner in Minneapolis but now it seems I may have to reconsider.
36,RED ALERT Hal and I have a mouse in our apartment.
36,DJS probably better that I missed lunch.
36,HAL: That stuff about the drunken slob was comedy gold.
36,I will be in NYC all next week - yet again I have to be in NY on September 11th.
36,After that 1-1/2 hour Marathon Medley (more like the Sweeney Sisters on crack) we finally got to the winner....the people have spoken: And the people chose the 20-year-old Texan cocktail waitress - Kelly Clarkson All kidding aside having been involved in choral music for most of my life I've heard good singers as well as really bad singers...and I have to say - Kelly is one of the best I've heard for someone her age.
36,I am very surprised (and disappointed) to see all you hard-core U2 fans have not even mentioned the fact that U2 is coming out with its second 'Best Of' collection in November.
36,A very ill person has given the Walgreens pharmacy the wrong phone number Hal and I keep getting their automated calls informing this person that their prescription is ready.
36,Billygoat has officially moved out of his place and out of Chicago.
36,I had the honor of golfing with Hal and Bobo le Clown this weekend.
36,Oh man...I miss all the cool dirt while I'm out of the office including the cake stampede.
36,I just had the most terrifying experience.
36,Today I had a terrifying experience.
36,Yesterday I had a terrifying experience.
36,Dear Duffer What happened yesterday Signed Stoner
36,Have you ever had one of those days where some things go incredibly right (you get an unforeseen pay raise no where near your review date and you get a traffic ticket thrown out) and some things go incredibly wrong too (you're sick your company loses a key account there are struggles at home) Well I had such a day yesterday.
36,Stoner Congratulations I can't wait to read your stuff and I really can't wait for that point in the future when I can say 'I knew her when...'
36,Um - I gave that magazine an idea for another story and guess what.
36,Greetings Pandyland As Panda mentioned I'm currently in NYC staying with my bro/sis-in-law (aka 'my peeps') for the week.
36,Just to let y'all know - HAL is here in NYC We just went to lunch.
36,Stoner: I'm so proud of you I just don't know what else to say.
36,That sounds like some lame-o joke off of a Laffy Taffy wrapper.
36,A bird that buries its head in mashed potatoes
36,I guess I need to ask: What
36,What do you get when you cross a turkey and an ostrich
36,And to have a hostile dentist on your hands is a very dangerous situation indeed
36,Panda Bear I did not know you were a dentist Signed Duf
36,It's about time I openly bashed the company I work for.
36,Hey kids...rock n' roll rock on...etc.
36,Why can't you do it Why can't you set your monkey free All it takes is a little doing.
36,Anyone who knows me pretty well knows that I love monkeys.
36,Burn Junkie This morning I found myself thinking about the summer vacation I took with my family in August.
36,I just have one question: If you have a regular site and a sister site is that incest
36,Hiya Kids... Nah I didn't go into hiding I just decided to shut ol' Soft Drink down for a multitude of reasons.
36,I think DJS had to go into hiding because of that whole fiasco with the Chipotle Mafia.
36,DJS what happened to Soft Drink
36,Im running into a little trouble here this morning.
36,Little Purple Pill/A Guy from Nebraska/I'm in love I'm pretty sure I have acid reflux disease...it was only a matter of time.
36,Hey thanks I had a great time on Saturday even if it was a bit low-key.
36,Hey guys DJS - Nice work with the links and photo page Me likey.
36,Why is everyone so quiet today.... Delayed-onset PBJ hangover
36,If we go to Milwaukee it has to be the Pandyland Bratwurst Jamboree.
36,To quote Bjork: 'Sometimes the things I do astound me.'
36,Abort Abort Abort Someone already took pandyland as a Yahoo user name....So our official e-mail is: pandylandblog@yahoo.com Pandyland members e-mail me at annie_hultgren@yahoo.com if you would like the password.
36,Panda...I'm on it like a Jimmy-Cap.
36,Regarding The Milwaukee Pandyland Gala: it's really hard to find body-building midgets on this short notice.
36,So now that the pics are 'live' on Ofoto.com who needs Admin rights to put 'em up on this site (or at least via link) DJS Are you up to the task The no-links look of this site has become a bit mundane.
36,Props to Panda for the great pics You'd think by this point in my life I'd know enough not to drink near flashbulbs but alas I am naive.
36,At its height the internet like a vibrant democracy provides a forum for the free exchange of ideas.
36,Okay I'm only admitting this because they are gone now but I used to have plantars warts all over the bottoms of my feet.
36,I'd like to have another Jamboree soon as I don't remember much of the last one... sigh.
36,She's gone for the day so I'll sneak to her cube and eyeball the situation.
36,I thought knowing the fate of the drink would be enough but it only triggered more questions: 1.
36,I must know -- did the drink make it to CK 2's desk intact
36,To quote DJS: Duf Fer's PBJ1 play-by-play is 'COMEDY PLATINUM.'
36,Pandyland Burrito Jamboree (PBJ1 - to those in the know): Would You Rather read a really long post about the PBJ1 or be forced to read bunghole for a week Where to begin...
36,Warning There are jokes on specially marked Diet Coke bottles.
36,News Flash: Duf Fer and I just got back from a quick jaunt to Rainbow Foods where I was asked to pick up some treats for a training session.
36,I'm thinking Lynard Skynard (in honor of America's Sweetheart Reese): In Birmingham they love the guv-nah (ew ew ew) And we all did what we could do Not watergate it does not botha me Does your conscience botha you now tell me true.
36,Roy Sounds like a Grade A suckerhead.
36,Speaking of Roy I sent that guy an invite and he never posted a damn thing here.
36,Please tell me you were able to fit Ben into your luggage.
36,I just looked at the weather and it's supposed to be 30 frickin degrees in Minneapolis this weekend.
36,I want to clear up a misconception.
36,Why is it that when we write something cheesy in a greeting card we sometimes feel compelled to add the words just kidding I just did that as if my coworker would think I was serious when I wrote birthdays are so great you should have them more often For one thing isnt even possible.
36,Stoner to satisfy your love of rap and my love of duets we should sing a little diddy that combines both.
36,Two 'rritos (I thought they needed a nickname) and Lil' Sickie WILL be there I assure you.
36,I'm thinking two burrito and four drink minimum on friday.
36,Wow...my reputation as a crank caller is spreading.
36,Now that the P-town excitement has died down I can focus my energy on gearing up for the Pandyland Burrito/Karaoke Jamboree In other news our crazy neighbors still have anti-window-washer paraphernalia on their door.
36,I spent last weekend in Portland with Stoner and Mrs. Headrick.
36,Pandyland turned Haiku Town... TGIF Thank God it's Friday A burrito would be nice Stiff drink sounds better Cancelled Wedding Picked up the invites Can't reuse those things - dammit.
36,Five Things by Fer Duf: 1.
36,Panda B: Yeah I'm guessing your talking about the ass-play scene with Ralphie and Janice.
36,Some of my personal drama has died down a bit since last Friday so I thought I'd come here to Pandyland for a little respite.
36,You know Stoner might be onto something.
36,EXCUSE ME I am the centerpiece of Pandyland.
36,Dear Hal What was our choice No one else was posting.
36,'Alias' is a really good show.
36,I have Spicy Cheddar Goldfish Crackers.
36,Okay 'Jan' is sitting in the cube next to me reading a book during her lunch hour.
36,Wow - wonder who the hell they hired... must be Mary F--king Poppins.
36,Stoner that totally sucks You would have been awesome for that job.
36,...and rob me of my super human strength ...won't it grow back thicker and more coarse ...then won't I be like all the freaks in the world with hairless foreheads
36,Duf May I interest you in a tweezer Stoner
36,Something about me you may not know: I have a white hair growing out of the middle of my forehead.
36,This magic marker is making me high.
38,I'm alone in the office today doing the last bit of packing.
38,The movers are here today and it's freaking me out.
38,More pictures... My sister Karen and my nephew Blake came to New York for a visit.
38,The movers are coming on Wednesday but instead of packing I decided to post the pictures from my last trip to Denmark.
38,As I was starting to pack this week-end not only did I produce 5 garbage bags full of clothes and shoes to get rid of I found some old pictures of Jim and I back in the Day.
38,I was going over the Brooklyn Bridge tonight and looked back to see the 'tribute of lights'.
38,Jim Kendall has been visiting from Madrid for the past few days and last night we had a chance to meet up with Edward Sarah and Alba.
38,The countdown to the move has begun.
38,Oops I overwrote my blog Well I know these were pictures of my apartment Kolding and my sniff Audi A3 that I am returning this week because I bought a Renault Megane.
38,Dan Spikol came into the office the other day and snapped this picture of me at my new desk.
38,I thought this was worth a blog.
38,At the beginning of June I had to go to Milan for work.
38,TOO MUCH SPAM I can't take it anymore so I am going to retire leah@chezleah.com for a little while.
38,While playing with iPhoto I realized that I could export my photos to a QT slideshow movie.
38,This week was back to work after my vacation in Greece...
38,I was back in the big apple last week for work and for Edward and Sarah's wedding.
38,I was hoping that my last three week trip to the states would be the last of my business travelling for 2002 but no such luck.
38,Here are some of the pictures from last month and my trek through the states (only a couple eastern and midwestern ones).
38,Pictures from the rockin' LEGO Direct Christmas Party.
38,Lars and I had the cheeziest New Year's Eve ever in Hurgada Egypt.
38,As I mentioned in an earlier blog my birthday present from Lars was a trip to Prague on Valentine's Day week-end.
38,Lars and I just returned from a week of meetings in Toyko and Seoul.
38,I finally made it to Madrid to see Jim and Emmanuelle just in the nick of time.
38,A few weeks ago Lars and I were showed around London by the Gillespies (Colin Ginger and Caty Mac).
38,Lars and I (mostly Lars since it was my first) had a traditional Danish Easter lunch for a few friends on April 18th and we took a couple of pictures... there are also many of pictures of the house we are buying These were taken before the deal was finalized which is going on now.
38,With just 13 days before we move into the house it's a bit frantic.
38,When I got home after being away for work for two weeks so much progress had been made on the house It's really starting to come together.
38,We are now officially home owners We had the keys to the house before everything was final and started working... We started by cleaning everything and painting the bedrooms.
38,We're moving a week from today... here's a few more pictures of the progress that's been made.
38,We spent the two weeks of our vacation moving in and working on the house and the yard.
38,The past few months have been incredibly busy and I've been neglecting my blog terribly.
38,The Virtual Christmas party was in Kolding last month.
38,Lars and I went to Florida to visit family during our Christmas break.
38,The past few weeks have been cold rainy difficult and emotional.
38,Lars and I hosted a party for the BIONICLE team in April.
38,We had our first of a few successful parties here at Bekkasinvej in February.
38,Lars and I spent last week-end in Hamburg for our 2 year anniversary.
38,Trying to learn this language is killing me I literally couldn't bring myself to go to class tonight I always come home with such a headache.
38,One evening after spending all day at the BIONICLE booth at Comic-con I got my picture taken with Corey Feldman.
23,yesterday was a great day had learnt a lot of good things one of them being that my core competency (all those doing a strategic management course shall understand the importance of this term) is my optimism.
23,Thanks Nakul for introducing me ... i know this is quite a late since you introduced this to me or rather i got to know abt it through u somehow .... but then its never too late and i am lazy so both things go hand in hand ok guys so all u guys who are reading this lemme tell you that i am poor at those writing skills (at one time i thought i was some big hot stud to write great things now i know that most of what i wrote was what most people in this business school call globe though i still regard this globe of high quality) Its a tough world and things this side are making things tougher none the less every day is an opportunity to learn to witness something new to understand someone more and to understand yourself more .... to improvise.
15,Wow Its like all of a sudden I feel sad.
15,I would just like to say all of this is bullshit.
43,Okay okay...I couldn't take it anymore.
43,Yeah someone has to write about this don't they It might as well be yours truly.
43,Go go go Get it done NOW Faster Cheaper You are a loser if you don't get out of bed and RUSH to work and do a great devoted job for 8.0 hours and you don't go right back home and WORK on things at home Do NOT sit DOWN.
43,File under: Too Weird to be True.
41,This blogging is a new thing for me although writing is not.
41,Have you ever noticed how many people use terms of endearment just out of habit Personally I don't use any terms of endearment even with my own family.
41,So here I am listening to my neighbor's son's band jamming in their garage and watching MonstersInc.
41,Aha A list 'cause I often list things in my head over and over and over.
41,some things that people do that really peeve me: Tell me something that they think I should know but I don't and act like I am the idiot because I didn't know it Tell me something that I do know that doesn't bear repeating Tell me something that I don't know but don't want to know Tell me something that they know that is none of my business Think that they are God's Gift to Mankind Act like they think they are GGtoM Think that I give a rat's patootie about their financial problems when I have more than my share of my own Tell people that they shouldn't be telling personal problems that 1st person couldn't do a thing about Subject me or others to their own preferences without maybe taking a moment to consult for an opinion 35-40 year old women who sit at work and act like 13 year old boys making obsene noises and laughing about it (immature to the max) People that don't do their work slough it off on others then can't understand why people don't like them and can't understand why they never accomplish anything worth while People that dress inappropriately for their work or for the places they go Inappropriate displays of affection in public (remember there are children out there and we wouldn't want our own children seeing other people doing those things) People that don't teach their children values hobbies and how to respect other people and their property People that think it is cute to teach their children to cuss (we're really teaching them to use their english properly) Asking the elderly for financial help when most of the elderly have enough of their own financial problems Mistreating other people and animals People that live where it is cold by choice and constantly whine and complain about the cold People that jump to conclusions People that interrupt conversations just to hear themselves People that think they have to compete with everyone for the most friends you know he who has the most friends wins People that think the whole day at work is just a competition People that think they have to control all situations People that can't work together as a team by puttins aside problems People that bring home to work and the attitudes they get from things that happen at home People with a bad attitude People that never smile and finally People that whine about anything and everything Well I gotta go Well then that was a list worth writing at least to me
41,sowhat do I think about...... about food and why I eat or don't eat what I can eat pork liver but not beef liver because it smells pissy to my.
14,Well...im bored and got nothing to do (well actually i got plenty to dojust dont feel like doing) so i decided to list down some of me nicks: 1)CosmoNoxmi very 1st nick and most commonly used nick.I refer this as my prime nick.

16,Hey Weekend is going pretty good so far.
16,Hey I'm sick of Xanga and Bridet told me to get a blogger.
16,This is the first post on this blog.
16,I am leaving for NJ today...going to be there for the rest of Augest.
16,Today I went to my uncle's place and then we went to the Statue or Liberty and took some pictures nad stuff...it was pretty fun although the ferry ride to the island and back didnt really go over to well i've now found out that I do get motion sickness.
16,wow so many good things have happened in the past couple of days...I got a gmail account thanks to my uncle made my gmail account my msn account ( something ive been trying to do for almost a year ).
16,My grandmother had won some free 20 min call to India thing which she wasted today by calling the wrong house...that would make me feel real stupid if that was me... Oh well she still has a free long-distance plan to anywhere in America and Canada (which I tend to be using quite frequently)
16,Today there was a 'brown party' at my aunts house and being a brown party you can expect that the 'arriving on time' concept if lost on the guests.
16,This summer i played sum ball.
16,Well after going to bed at 2AM I got my 10 hours of beauty sleep and woke up....at 12 (for all you math challenged people out there).
16,Well today (all one hour of it..) I helped Andrew's brother get a rom and emulator he wanted...It really does pay to know your way around google.
16,Wow...my second post via email...just doing this too see what all (if anything) google sends as a sig after my default... -- CHANDER
16,Wow this would be my first blog sent via email instead of using blogger.com.
16,The stupid comments finaly started working...they didnt show up till today and i posted them like how many days ago jeez But yes they have finaly started showing up today after endless hours of looking over the template code 1 .
16,One of my friends Andrew decided to go bald while I was away in NJ Jeez.
23,Can I please make it through 10 minutes of an NBA-related broadcast without hearing the word 'chippy' It's starting to reach 'there is no there there' and 'sooner rather than later' proportions.
23,So three of four gunmen within a surrounded compound manage to escape.
23,Some people were wondering why I didn't ask which company had the worst E3 instead of which platform.
23,Going to try using the new Blogger for a while.
23,Well the Canadians just finished tallying their votes a minute before I write this and what a defeat it turned out to be for Martin.
23,Seems like there's only one who happens to make 95% of the articles when they're looking for a comment about President Bush.
23,Many in the media have been telling us how wrong and downright deceitful the president and vice president have been this week for stating that there were connections between Iraq and al qaeda.
23,Man I really hate to slag off the fantastic work that Ben Goodger and Scott MacGregor have accomplished with their respective Mozilla projects Firefox and Thunderbird but what I've seen lately is disheartening.
23,Well Ronald Wilson Reagan passed away today.
23,So when the unsurprising news that 75 percent of the terrorists involved in the recent attach made the news an unnamed Saudi official claimed that it was okay because the hostages were the first priority &mdash; coulda fooled me going by the death toll &mdash; and that they knew where the others were and could get them whenever they wanted.
23,So a national security advisor to the Clinton administration who happens to be a foreign policy advisor to John Kerry stuffs classified documents and notes about them into his jacket and down his pants and leaves the National Archives with them.
23,No it's not a picture of Vietnam vets letting Senator Kerry know what they thought of his anti-war activity.
26,You just have no idea of how much I want to archieve success The reason why I am so eager to archieve success is to prove myself.

26,From the toppest group to the newly added group a new nh is needed to add.
26,nexthop is aodv_nhlist type data has no copy constructor for itself.
26,mt_flag_co indicates if its copath item has a key; (for non-grop member it has no key of itself) mt_flag_key indicates if its keypath item has a key.
26,So I have to make sure every messsage is received by all the receiptors.
26,this new member should be copied in the copy constructor or it will be lost during transmission.
26,When some rt_entries are to be deleted rt_seqno is set to odd and hops is set to 255.
26,I added the source node address in sendMACT parameters.
26,In MAODV sendMact is invoked after 0.5 second after sendMRQ.
26,Normally agents are connected in the scripts so that they can transmit data to each other.
26,rt_update sometimes uses multicast route sequence no.
26,The reason is no route information between neighboring nodes is recorded.
26,In the class Node it has a member struct SignalPower neighborSignal[50]; which has only 50 items.
26,But why I can use list template well I don't know just remember undefined reference error is incurred by the template
26,the method of sponsor sending key info up along the tree to the children_super needs to be optimized.
26,The method of sponsor sending key information up along the tree to the children_super needs to be optimized.
26,1. for children of super node of the sponsor or JOIN_CHILD_SUPER The first child_super nodes need to change its mt_co_id because mt_co_id should be the newly created group address.
26,Before the header of a packet p is set it is all zero.

27,it's one of quotations that i got from our daily bread.. (not a name of bakery shop ).. when i read that quotations.. i was speechless.. it's not just a sentence.. but the meaning of the sentence really comforts me.. i am not too religious though.. i almost attend every sunday service.. i even join 2 choirs in my church.. (heh) but still.. so each time i have problem or so many problems i always try so hard to remember that sentence.. somehow.. it works.. that sentence can strengthen me.. i know god works in any way that can't be understandable.. or so unpredictable for us -a human being- but i know he'll always there for me.. not only for reminding me of the good... but to carry me.. in my devastated time... p.s: i think 'my good side' is all around me when i write this heheheeheheheee....

16,This is my first post of what will hopefully be many.
23,I should be asleep but I am not...instead I am up just thinking about the past present and wondering what the future will hold.
23,Concerned for the Future By Sandy Escobedo January 10 2004 1:19am New York NY As I sit here and read through endless articles on Latino experiences coming particularly from those who are from LA I can’t help but wonder how “Latino” are my kids going to be I ask myself this because I am presently coping with the confusion one encounters when your passport reads “U.S.
23,Life in the NYC certainly has taken its toll on me.
23,I am in my graduate class right now and I am having a hard time trying to seem at least half interested.
16,The start of the day wasnt so bad i woke up at 12:05 watched tv for a while then went outside to mow the grass with my mom but as u know in my family when everything is going good somthing bad is about to happen and it did.
16,Today a Sunday will probably be the most busiest day for my parents because they have a retarded baptisms to go to which I think is absurd because they will not even be the godparent What the hell.
16,Today was quiet despite my mom ruining my tranquillity by waking me up to help her get some groceries which really pissed me off.my brother came by today to come eat Bar b que whick my mom made because my dad cant cook for shit.
16,Today at practice I felt really good and I think I have improved far more than I expected.
16,Everyone of my family members are out working or at school learning new things but me im just chillin here talking to some friends on the internet.
16,Its been a while since ive wrote a new entry in my blog but im finally back.
16,It was one of the best weekends I've ever had.
16,It's so late but i'm talking to friends who have all these problems with some girls so instead of listening to that bullshit i've decided to type this post.
16,In the midst of a good day i recive a letter in the mail informing me that i've been cut from the high school baseball team due to missing the entire offsesson which really pissed my coach off.
16,Man this summer has been so awesome and long.
16,Today at cross country practice i was really scared because one of my friends who i was throwing rocks said i broke a car windshield.
16,Somtimes i wonder if...... the person i am going to be destined with looks at the moon while i am.
16,This weekend was by far the coolest and most relaxing but as u all know my life does not always stay that relaxin all the time.
26,My lovely and fabulous Tivo recorded the E True Hollywood Story of Diff'rent Strokes.
26,I love the summer before the Olympics because all of the fun sports events are on Screw football and basketball Baseball is a fun event to attend during the summer- but I am talking about Wimbledon every summer and lovely gymnastics swimming and diving trials up until the August wonderfulness that is the Olympics.
26,I know it is Tuesday but I am finally telling about my weekend.
26,So I thought I would be good at the blog stuff because I love telling lots of random stories.
26,So I am totally freaked out by this whole blogging thing- I don't know what to say Zuhair helped nothing by being completely obnoxious about what I had already written Thanks a lot Zuhair I am using this opportunity to tell you to go back to where you came from (This is a joke other readers if there are any Minorities can bond like this and no one likes his kind anyway anymore they are so last decade).
26,If you are reading this you might wonder why part of the title is 'the misadventures' (I take it if you know me you know why it is called Action Jackson).
26,So I am trying this whole blog thing out...I don't know if I will be very good at it.
26,This new show Amish in the City is my new favorite reality show I am officially addicted.
26,Okay y'all- my project for the last few weeks was to figure out my finances.
26,I felt the need to have a hit counter on my blog because I can kind of tell if people are checking it out or if I am just talking to myself.
26,I have decided to start a new reason for posting on my blog- my mom and her random thoughts.
26,Well I will have everyone (or the two people who read this) know that I am CPR trained.
26,I added this Blog on my website where people can write about their break-ups.
26,So one of my good friends has left the lovely environs of LA.
26,Did anyone see the Wedding show yesterday on ABC I think For all my Wellesley friends do y'all remember Christine(a) Hrul I remember chrul from the message boards- anyway she was on this show because she randomly decided to marry her HLS boy in Prague in a castle.
26,Well the weekend held quite a few surprises for my friend shermain from the sherm and I.
26,So I heard that The Village was extremely dissapointing- if anyone out there in Blog world has seen it let me know.
26,I was driving around running some errands and a Creed song came on I think it is called 'Higher' - I know I know insert collective groan here...at first I was laughing and joking around that Creed was over- they are kinda freaks at least Scott Stapp- but hey if someone with a ridiculous Jesus-complex wants to take me higher where blind men see...then hey why not Deep thoughts by (Action) Jack(son) Handy....
23,Well I have so much to say and so little time in which to say it.
25,Do you rely on a 'good gut reaction' or that 'special feeling' when interviewing perspective employees Are you confident that your new hires will be successful Are you good at interviewing prospective employees When I talk with executives and ask if they are good at selecting successful employees they often indicate they have (or have not) been lucky lately.

25,My blog could never be complete without this all time favourite song of mine... the intoxication power of Love I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand I dream of fire Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire And in the flames Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire This desert rose Each of her veils a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this And as she turns This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams This fire burnsI realize that nothing's as it seems I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand I dream of rain I lift my gaze to empty skies aboveI close my eyes This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand Sweet desert rose Each of her veils a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this Sweet desert rose This memory of Eden haunts us all This desert flower This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of the love

25,Looks like I have been cursed with regards to my weekends something or another goes wrong with me here My saturday was quite disturbing to say the least.
25,For a long time while watching serials like B&B Santa Barabara Dynasty Young and restlessNeighbours etc I used to wonder when the reference used to be made about your 'First true love' Everytime it used to be picturized as this feeling which was unmatchable and something which could never die from your life I used to wonder hey its' just a person who comes into your life and then moves away and you then move to the next person...so whats the big fuss all about But then a few days ago I began to take a different angle to this ideology and decided to do a little research on why it is said that ' true love is the purest form of love and why one cant ever get over it for life ' First and foremost when does a person fall in love the first time Well one can hardly say coz true love is quite different from a crush or an infactuation it's this feeling of weightlessness which overtakes a person and makes them feel that the entire world in which they exist is too perfect when in reality they know quite well that it's far from being called perfect When one falls in love for the first time the emotions which conquer the heart and mind are quite unimaginable really everything feels amazing there is a complete halo aroud the person and things feel absolutely perfectly warm and romantic When does this happen to people well can happen at the age of 10 50 or even 80...one never knows when they'll find that first person for whom they will have such overwhelming feelings for....it just happens one fine day Everyone remembers their first love.

16,My heart is hurting beyond words The pain is tearing up my soul These days have seen my spirit die My life propelled out of control My wounds lie naked to the world My depth of suffering exposed This damaged past can never heal Until this nightmare book is closed.
16,Remember I will still be here As long as you hold me in your memory Remember when your dreams have ended Time can be transcended Just remember me I am the one star that keeps burning so brightly It is the last light to fade into the rising sun I'm with you Whenever you tell My story For I am all I've done I am that one voice in the cold wind That whispers And if you listen you'll hear me call across the sky As long as I still can reach out and touch you Then I will never die Remember I'll never leave you If you will only Remember me Remember me Remember... me...
16,It begins very small Seems like nothing much at all Just a germ just a speck just a grain But the seed has been sown And before you know it's grown It has spread through your life like a stain And its power will strangle your love and your joy And its hunger consumes for it lives to destroy Hate is a star; it becomes who you are Not the hated but the hater has a torment that's greater It will eat you alive consume you and spit you out Hate's gonna win that there's no doubt about Hate doesn't care who you are- Hate is the Star Learning hate is an art even people who are smart can be caught can be crushed can be creamed Hate has swallowed you whole Did you think you're in control Hate you though hate you spoke hate you dreamed All your hate gave me substance your lives are undone It's your eve of destruction your hatred has won How could it come to pass This awful twist of fate How could I hurt you This madness can't be so I can't believe it I never dreamed that any barriers could rise Or that I'd ever see the stranger in your eyes Our hearts were hurting both the same The hurt was tearing up our souls The fury in us made us blind We could not see beyond the pain Ares---
16,Now it's time I fear to tell I've been holding it back so long But something strange deep inside of me is happening I feel unlike I've ever felt And it's makin' me scared That I may not be what I think I am What of us what do I say Are we both from a different world Cos every breath that I take I breathe it for you And I'm so afraid.
16,Both sides of isolation and freedom Halt and hide in my heart Eyes close as the sky depends on the Strength and weakness of a single god while the breast of the knife shines True feelings show through the mask I put on my head Absolutely the difference seems Absolutely this night by myself only within myself More and more at a distance More and more I'm the only one who goes to the end of the sky to escape Anxiousness and wishes mix to oppose my destiny The angels and devils individually whisper inside my head Without compromise today and also tomorrow can make a difference Absolutely the difference seems Absolutely not only are the soul and eternity the same More and more its sweltering Absolutely this night by myself only within myself Arigato Ken

37,Something Oswald Chambers wrote over 100 years ago in My Utmost For His Highest.
37,The body that is sown is perishable it is raised imperishable; it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body.

37,From the book Restoring the Balance Between the King the Kingdom and the Holy Spirit by Ern Baxter And when He is come [unto you] He will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment (John 16:8) Through whom is He going to reprove the world Where does the Holy Spirit live at this moment He lives in the corporate Body of God's people and through the corporate Body of God's people.
37,In The Passion of the Christ there is a scene where Mary wants to get closer to Christ.
37,I asked a question at small group last week: 'What do you want to ask God but are afraid to because you think it is impossible' Two members immediately jumped in with what we call 'the low fruit' or 'the Sunday-school answer' -- Nothing is impossible for God I've already asked Him for everything.
37,What does it mean to give Is it a contribution An offering A tithe What's a tithe Should it be a tenth or should it be all What is 'all' Can we 'give' to God What is important about giving to God The heart of the giver The size of the gift The way the gift is used The discipline of giving Is giving a discipline If so what is the purpose of the discipline When we give to a local church who is the recipient of the gift Is it even a gift or is it an investment Should we expect a return Where does the gift go after it is given Where should it go Should we care If you are concerned about what happens to it after it is given was it truly given Does it go to those in need Who determines need If it goes to others does it still go to God What role does God play in this Are we pooling resources Pooling them where For what Are we sharing or giving With whom To whom If you are worried about what happens after it is given was it really given in the first place

46,Yesterday I was seen by a different doctor than usual.
46,I feel like a fraud in doctors waiting rooms surrounded by coughs and colds small children with flushed faces and the elderly accompanied by carers with too loud over cheerful voices.

46,I wonder why I use a pseudonym when writing both my poetry and my blog The more I think about it the less I can come up with a valid reason.

39,The Periodic Table of Wine Fault Chemistry I was looking for a way to communicate the major types of wine faults to the public that could be used by both the wine geeks and the general public.
39,The Alchemy of Fermentation First the definition of alchemy which is useful here: Alchemy (AL KEM E); The medieval and Renaissance precursor to modern chemistry characterized by mystical philosophy and attempts to turn 'base' metals such as lead and tin into 'noble' metals such as gold and silver.
39,Lady Bugs MOG and Life A little known defect to those outside of the Eastern U.S. winemaking regions is a little problem know as Ladybug Taint... Good gried another taint Sure is and this one is even tougher to resolve than TCA.
39,NASCAR and Wine I guess that's what it smells like burning rubber.
39,Understanding Wine Allergies I am often asked 'Why does this wine give me a headache' I would have to characterize this thumping head routine as a fault with wine but obviously not one the winemaker can do anything about.
39,Something about the name... Cork taint I talk to a number of people who seem to know a LOT about corked wines yet they continue to force me to believe that cork taint is caused only by bad cork.
39,Everthing you Ever Wanted and Needed to Know about Sulfites and Wine Preservatives are an important part of wine making and the consuming public should not worry about sulfites in wine (under normal circumstances).
39,Glass shape affects wine's chemistry Exclusive from New Scientist Print Edition.
39,So what is MLF (Malolactic Fermentation) Anyway As wineries increase the amount of information on their labels and websites often winedrinkers see that a wine has undergone malolactic fermentation to achieve its current flavor.
39,What is cork and why do we use it (Part 1) We recently got an email question so simple yet elegant that it spawned a chain reaction of research and blogging to both provide a decidely geeky and relevent answer.
43,OK so let's address some of the things that I know people will say to the idea that religion and science are (or should be) pursuing the same end.
43,Hello and welcome to SPRT - Science in Pursuit of Religious Truth .
43,I still haven't finished part II of my earlier blog entitled 'Who Do You Work For Good Or Evil And How to Tell...' But if you've read that far you know that I've said your first test is whether or not you are telling the truth.
43,I am still working on Part II of the 'Who Do You Work For' blog.
43,All of the recent legal activity surrounding the Partial Birth Abortion Act has had me thinking.
43,I received a lovely thoughtful response to my second post.
43,You know one of the things that I think needs to be mentioned is the frequent use of the Bible quotation 'Judge not lest ye be judged.'
43,Well this was a complete surprise.
43,Part II: Have you been educated Or brainwashed....
46,After a day Of great accomplishments And yet of none A day of never leaving And not being worldly A day of not accomplishing anything of material value That will be of benefit To my material progression After a day such as this I look And with great wonder I regard The accomplishments Of revelations revealed Of friendships deepened And of some renewed Of bonds re-claimed And spirits lifted A day when I can see around me The souls I have touched And in so touching Have blessed And made happy The joy I have added The light I have shared And then I wish That every day Could be like this one.
46,Too long it has been Thank-you For remembrances For bringing Unity consciousness at times Of deep distress.
46,When love was the only gift I gave it freely A never ending source I drew from Deep within Across hardwires of black and grey I felt your feelings surge Fingers being interface conductors between you and me With all that is Inbetween Lettered keys and cables Wires silver blue Reached across the miles From me to you.
46,Finding a piece of yourself You had long ago misplaced When did you do this misplacing It was so long ago it eludes you now The memory does not however Now that you have found it again The memory of the loss Rings through loud and deafening And the empty space that mired your soul Is filled once again With joy and light Full circle Our inner workings Transcribe through reading Of each-other’s words And sensing Of each-other’s Joy And childlike wonder Yes I said yes Of course I remember you How could I not You calculate Hmmm Seems like I’ve known you 2 years Or maybe it was 10 I say Well it seems Like I knew you An eternity In another lifetime Welcome home jo smith june 2004 a mozer poem
46,I believe that we are the creators of our own life experiences - both the hardships and the happiness - this was the true meaning of 'free will'.
46,Good to remember I can create other people’s experiences Isn’t it only right that I should always make sure The experiences I create for them Are good and bring joy To their lives I have the choice The joyful experiences I create for them will expand outwards and touch others Through them The bad experiences I create for them will cause them to shrink From me and from the world Always I must choose carefully and consider The consequences Before choosing the action.
46,Finding a piece of yourself You had long ago misplaced When did you do this misplacing It was so long ago it eludes you now The memory does not however Now that you have found it again The memory of the loss Rings through loud and deafening And the empty space that mired your soul Is filled once again With joy and light Full circle Our inner workings Transcribe through reading Of each-other’s words And sensing Of each-other’s Joy And childlike wonder Yes I said yes Of course I remember you How could I not You calculate Hmmm Seems like I’ve known you 2 years Or maybe it was 10 I say Well it seems Like I knew you An eternity In another lifetime Welcome home jo smith june 2004 a mozer peom

47,When I do watch tv one of the shows I never try to miss is Extreme House Makeover.
47,Yanno I have a pet peeve(if you think there's only one ~snort~)....people who think it's not only their mission to educate us but to save us.
47,Usually around here (sometimes fondly referred to as 'The Zoo')Friday nights are quite laid back.
47,..and trust me it looks like a large hump to get over already.
47,be forewarned... my writing can not express at this moment just how livid I am feeling.
47,The last few days have centered around my mouth and the pain with an abscess under one of my teeth.
47,Everyday is Mothers' Day it's just that sometimes..ok.. most times.. we don't get to have as nice a day as we do today.
47,Over the last couple of months no make that the last year I have found it increasingly hard to role play in Camelot.
47,Yes today is turning out to be quite nice even though I was up all night reading The Da Vinci Code.
47,Have you ever had one of those days where you shouldn't play wth machines I'm having one~
47,Celebrating May Day at the Ren Faire was very nice.
47,Oh my oh my oh my... yesterday.
47,I understand that normalcy is relative to whomever.
47,The light dawned bright and promising early Sunday morning.

47,hand holding - you like to be in constant physical contact with your special someone but you don't want to take things too quickly.
47,You're GI Joe with the Kung Fu Grip You're strong tough and know how to kick some ass.
47,SELENE: You are selene Beautiful vivacious fierce and seductive Selene vowed she would destroy Lycans after her family was murdered by the werewolves.
47,It does not appear to be an oncoming train I am cautiously optimistic as I write this.
47,whoosh.... that's how I feel at the moment.
47,I swear it's a male thing.
47,Okay..okay already... here it is and there is no order to it: 1) I'm short.
47,Let me start off by saying that this is not a whine.
47,' Sissy ' The whisper snakes into my dreams on Monday morning at 9am.
47,I have had netscape uploaded for some time now.
47,It all started with the purchase of the webcam and it went downhill from there.
47,From somewhere deep in the Grove in her little tiny patch of compost the Shroom stirs.
47,Well at the moment 'The Zoo' is quiet.
47,The day has been fairly uneventful.
47,Actually I've been up since about 6 am or so.
47,I wouldn't exactly call it insomnia.
47,Let's see... the kids got their new apartment they move July 1st.
47,I am running on one cup of coffee currently and as those who know me best know I am not even remotely functional as a society defined human being until after the second cup is consumed but let's see if I can fake coherency.
47,WHAT WAS I THINKING 1) I'm a good mother.
47,Lady save me from twenty year olds Sprout works 5 days a week about 8 hours a day give or take as the Boss decides.
47,Perhaps at least until the next time.
47,This one doesn't even rate grabbing a shovel.
47,Yesterday my daughter called and asked if she and the family could come over and hang out a bit since they were out this way before one of her medical appointments.
47,I woke about around 4 am this morning as I often do these days and I am only now beginning to shake the feeling that came over me.
47,Well the conclusion of this test hasn't changed over the years.
47,You know I like the hovel.
47,I had it Incoming LONG Rant.
47,Okay now this is really starting to bug me.
47,The morning light added to the gleam in 'shroom's eyes.
47,A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him.
47,My name is 'Shroom and I live in a compost pile.
47,Maybe it's just dust bunnies hm Well I'm certainly not getting rid of them.
47,Where do I start What a weekend.
47,It's Thursday already I know for some people they are probably welcoming the thought that it's nearly the end of the work week.
47,The new babies are doing well getting fat.
47,You Are a Plain Ole Cup of Joe But don't think plain - instead think uncomplicated You're a low maintenance kind of girl... who can hang with the guys Down to earth easy going and fun Yup that's you: the friend everyone invites.
47,At about 7:30 am the 'shroom was abruptly pulled from a deep sleep and a weird dream (so she was thankful) by a sound she has known forever.
47,Funny how one starts off in one direction and with nothing more than a phone call it all changes.
47,It seems to be shaping up into an easy quiet vegetative day.
47,This blog probably won't be of much interest to anyone but myself.
47,When my husband was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer two years ago I felt like the rug had been jerked out from under me.
47,Oh mercy what day is this Monday if my calendar isn't lying.
45,We have flying machines A world full of dreams Chains and gold rings Plenty of things To make us happy We've walked on the moon Choose life all to soon Held silver spoons Plenty of things To make us Happy We'll talk all the while See little one's smile Go that extra mile Plenty of things To make us happy We'll stand at the gate Hating the weight Lifted...Far from our shoulders With troubles all gone Greet a new dawn Plenty of things To make us happy
45,From the sound's that echo forward; to words - once said atlast the start of silance choosen -that leads us from the past.
37,School Holiday coming up so I thought it would be nice for my babies to see their grandmother (and nice for me to have the house to myself...).
37,Number 2 daughter went to a friends house so son and I toddled off to do what he likes to do - go to PC World Gamezone Dixons anywhere he can get a multimedia hit.
37,OK. Sweet child o'mine has landed safely and informs me that it is very hot.
37,Well we managed the early start plane now airborne and just left with one hysterical child (and one who was quite unmoved).
37,Today I am tidying up like a woman possessed.
37,Kids got away ok so now I'm here alone.
37,Number one child doing fine and having a great time.
37,The electronic key to my car broke.
40,the day of departure and i find it unsetling as i jingle my key ring.
40,this is the day of departure and i was wide eyed at 5:15. an oddity for me.
40,well....after packing and repacking several times i think i have it.
40,Well my gauge before we take off says 7371 miles.
40,This was my final day of selling what I had left.
40,My mom gave me a book that is parents writing to their children.
40,My journey starts in less than 10 days and I got to spend some time with my daughter.
40,My parents have been informed 11 days prior to departure.
40,Decision has been made to split with my husband.
40,in portland maine right now at the library.
40,woke up this morning & someone asked me how long it took to get to maine &amp; it dawned on me that this is my 30th day on the road.
40,got in kind of late so didn't really talk to anybody.
40,this is where we viewed the top of the falls.
40,we had several views of full rainbows as we toured the falls on the boat.
40,can't say which is better both are spectacular.
40,as i crossed over into canada for the first time ever i got a glimpse of what a border guard looks like with no personality.
40,that much water - moving that fast can almost make you loose your cookies at times.
40,the last two nights have been particularly tough for me.
40,if i could fit a bumper sticker on the back of my bike it would read 'don't worry i don't always look this way.
40,'twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did.
40,just this morning i was journaling in my notebook the things that i would like about stopping & setting up house & the things i would miss about my road trip.
40,rush hour two days in a row.
40,tonight - going to niagra falls for the illumination tour.
40,1) just because it looks like a good road on the atlas doesn't mean necessarily that it is.
40,the whole reason i rode here is because people told me it was beautiful but when i pull in i'm too tired to explore &amp; just hit my tent thinking i will see it all tomorrow....soooo wrong as the rain ruined that idea
40,i thought i was doing pretty good picking out my camp site in fact i was darn proud of myself for taking a walk around the camp ground and finding the perfect spot where i could just ride my bike in and ride it out without trying to manouver it around to much....what i didn't really watch for was how close i was to the road.
40,riding through upper michigan....and run into my first fun (yeah right) road construction since i've been on my own.
40,i'm sure glad i had to stop for this road construction because the lady in the car in front hops out and runs back to me and tells me to put the helmet on - or i'm risking a $75 fine.
40,ironwood michigan is where i put my tent up for the night and so does martine.
40,through the state of wisconsin which by the way is state #8. my intended ride is hwy 2 to 13 and back to 2. i was glad i stopped at the tourist info center because she gave me another route because of road construction.
40,i know God made our bodies with all the senses we need to survive.
40,somebody said it is sweet clover.
40,ann marie has been a great inspiration over the last few days as she has been calling just to chat.
40,this is as far as i will take the north shore drive on this trip but someday i will be back because everybody i've talked to says i need to take this ride up into canada.
40,after exploring duluth a bit i take the scenic hiway up the north shore of lake superior.
40,seen and smelled a lot during my life but they always been squished somewhere on the road.
40,got my first glimpse ever of fire flies.
40,terry ann marie's friend....which forever be my friend now too has offered me a wonderful retreat at his cabin & 40 acres.
40,what a wonderful & much needed offer.
40,ever have one of those dreams that are just so real that you wake up in a cold sweat.
40,the campground i'm staying at i've been offered beer & pot.
40,my destination is duluth which is only 50 miles away....but i am very tired & still shaky from dumping my bike the day before.
40,ann marie & charlie will be amazed by this more than most of you because they actually saw my bike when i took off.
40,by the way when i pulled up to greg & linda's home on friday evening the 9th of july greg informs me that i just crossed over into minnesota.
40,after the kindness i've been shown the last several days i realize how selfish i've been in my own life & how important 'things' have been to me.
40,if there is one thing we rely on when traveling solo it is the kindness of strangers.
40,luckily i was pulling over to talk to a big strong biker that i had just met up the road.
40,seems everytime i drive around a big body of water i get lost....and you guessed it i always end up at junction 200. this let's me know i'm on the wrong road again.
40,this is a drive well worth it if you find yourself out this way.
40,as i leave minot i am driving about 5 mph under the speed limit.
40,raised in north dakota and some one asked me to paint a picture of the sun i would paint it hot pink.
40,rode only 20 miles & pulled over for gas & was seriously regretting packing up my tent.
40,camp parking lot is full of puddles.
40,...when you have 40 miles to go & the wind just blows & blows it seems like forever.
40,as i near culbertson montana wind gusts slow me down considerably.
40,turned 10k just outside glasgow montana.
40,yep getting a late start my first day.
40,getting thumbs up from the other bikers in town as they see this woman rider....loaded down and obviously traveling solo.
40,after riding so long i thought i would spend my first night at browning montana....until i rode into town and realized i felt like the only white woman in town.
40,i complained of charlie but i myself rode 348 miles the first day without stopping to eat.
40,rode about 100 miles with charlie before we say goodbye.
40,spent the night at wolf lodge coeur d' alene idaho.
40,wet on the windshield & wet on the glasses...for miles and miles.
40,charlie says we can slow down now but did we we put on some 230 miles up hiway coast 101. with the windy roads and rolling hills might as well been 400. someday i want to take some time and ride this coast.
40,met a girl hitch hiker today.
40,spent night near john day oregan.
40,not nearly as emotional as i thought i would be...but then charlie is still with me.
40,charlie and i have figured i can probably make it on $50 a day for gas meals and camping.
40,left before scheduled and traveled 12 hours.
40,it is gonna be hard leaving my cousins.
40,as i was in new jersey sitting in my hotel room i was watching the weather channel and found out i was headed right into tropical storm alex or so i thought.
40,it is so hard to keep up but north carolina is actually my 25th state i've ridden since i left wyoming.
40,well i've ridden 8000 miles since i've started my journey.
40,the only planned stop on the road of someone that i know.
40,i'm on my way to my cousins in north carolina and i know i need to make time to get there by her day off so everyone suggests the only easy way is to ride 1-95. so from new jersey to washington d.c. and almost to richmond virgina i ride the interstate.
40,well even after 30 days i find things i can live without.
40,my only knowledge of new jersey is what i learned from the turnpike.
40,after my iron butt run one more day at the hotel doesn't sound all that bad - so i splurge.
40,wow a bed never looked so good after riding for 25 hours straight.
40,wow i've never ridden through such heavy rain.
40,the visitor center was so helpful.
40,20 hours on the bike and guess what here comes the rain.
40,actually my night ride wasn't all that bad.
40,i got to say one thing for this city there bridges are spectacular.
