InvestmentBanking,Ah finally...someone else I know is coming here from Canada for a visit.
InvestmentBanking,Being gay in Korea is like being gay in the U.S. military...in 1950.
indUnk,Why can't I just learn to say no Last night at work a guy came in I hadn't seen in a while.
indUnk,I have a habit of constantly heading down dead-end roads that I KNOW are dead ends.
indUnk,Even though I am exhausted after today I must get in my rant to get a good night's sleep.
indUnk,Today Travis and I went out to run a few errands and have a nibble afterwards.
indUnk,Because I fear The Wraith and Hoggle equally as much it will probably be a while before a young fellow called Kristensen will hear about my joining the blogging world.
Student,Friends are like ships Anchored their lines by the harbor Each secrete their own goods Revealing only the hull Whether they bring wealth or disasters Cannot be foretold Some anchored for long others drift into the vast empty seas Some grow stale and become constant companions
Student,I looked upon the world A pulsing light Growing every minute Daring and brave was I I challenge its unknown might Blood was spilled Tainted the lands A new champion arises Such was its might I was imprisoned Chained to the bounds of eternity Strength and life was drained from me The brightness in my eye flickered and faded Sorrows and agony clenched my heart Fatigue was my constant companion Memories and nightmares haunted me The aura of it presence tremble me every moment Flesh rot and hang from my whitish limbs The seductive allure of hell draws me towards it Writing the last sentence of my life I watched my life flashed before me Like a rat was I Staring at the unassailable titan Witnessing my blade turning to dust My armor my faith swept away with the currents My shield my honor is what I have left Crows and vultures flew the skies covering the sun to an eclipse Jokers and minstrels both sang and mock at my foolishness Perusing his poems And studying mine Looking down at my own demise Drowned my heart and soul
Student,'Splinters Love' Dawn of the sun Is the end of night The end of summer Is the onlslaught of winter So many times When you love someone Even loving was painful When the love was broken So much does the splinters of love hurt the heart The birth of love Is the dawn of joy And the end of love Is the renewal of pain
Student,'The puppet' His eyes sparkled A smile brightened his face He danced in the lucid night Twirling and spinning He sang songs equal of a bard Graceful was his movements and his soul and body became one Kings and queens were dazzled by his arts Servants and slaves paused in awe Time drags on And kings yawned Time and his mind became mine Strings attached Snapped and torned His purpose was fulfilled And so he was to end A smile faded his off his face
Student,'The deer' Eyes darted Ears perked Shuffling sound of dead leaves Fingers of the frigid wind caressed the innocent soul Muscles and sinews tensed Watchful eyes watched its prey And wolves howl in triumphant Dark clouds shrouded the moon Shadows danced back and forth Signalling the end
Student,There have been times in my life when I have felt helpless.It is perhaps the most acute pain a person can know founded in frustration andand ventless rage.The nick of sword upon a battling soldier's arm cannot compare to the anguish a prisoner feels at the crack of a whip.
Student,'Five for fighting' Song I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find The better part of me I'm more than a bird I'm more than a plane I'm more than some pretty face beside a train And it's not easy to be me I wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie 'Bout a home I'll never see It may sound absurd But don't be naive Even heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed But won't you concede Even heroes have the right to dream And it's not easy to be me Up up and away away from me Well it's alright You can all sleep sound tonight I'm not crazy or anything I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive Men weren't meant to ride With clouds between their knees I'm only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street I'm only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me inside of me Inside of me yeah inside of me inside of me I'm only a man in a funny red sheet I'm only a man looking for a dream I'm only a man in a funny red sheet And it's not easy… It's not easy to be me
Student,'The hierachical order' Blades tore skies apart Lightning splits the wounded bird Silent winds swept the lands asunder Angry clouds darkened the skies Scythe of reapers plough the cities Lucid dreams haunted in forms of echoing shadows Treachery spoke louder than compassion Every corner was a silent dagger And a coup practiced neater than a courteous bow Even masters contorted in fear While slaves waited for the darkness to descend Shadows rise and fall unendingly
Student,Unsurprisingly it is the 14 of june.
Student,'Knowledge' Pages withered wise and old Pages flipped dust fluttered high and low Worn and tattered hid its view from common man Centuries flickered in the light of words The wise wrote its course And the lesser ones seek its enchantment
Student,'Truth of reality' As I sat on the sun set hill How the scenery seems mundane compared to you Looking into your enchanting eyes The presence of you gladdens my heart And your words sweeten my soul Time stopped parallel to space Holding your warm hands seeped the strands of love You are the one Who I’m willing to sacrifice for upon the altar of love To brave through the flames of hell To don the shinning armor and be your knight To hear your sorrows and despairs To understand and love you But when the dawn of reality shines upon me How I realize This was all an elusive dream There is no everlasting love No true love Every lie renders me apart Leaving me torn and tattered in an inevitable demise Dark devils fed my soul And men mocked my foolishness Winter now prey upon the land Leaving it bare and dead Life faded into the whispering wind
Student,Warmth||||||||||||||||||58% Intellect|||||||||||||||||||||70% Emotional Stability||||||||||||||||||||||||74% Aggressiveness||||||||||||||||||58% Liveliness|||||||||||||||42% Dutifulness||||||||||||||||||||||||78% Social Assertiveness|||||||||||||||||||||66% Sensitivity|||||||||||||||||||||66% Paranoia||||||||||||||||||||||||||||86% Abstractness||||||||||||||||||||||||78% Introversion|||||||||||||||||||||66% Anxiety||||||||||||||||||||||||74% Openmindedness||||||||||||||||||||||||||||86% Independence|||||||||||||||||||||62% Perfectionism||||||||||||||||||58% Tension|||||||||||||||||||||66%
Student,'Power of love' They say angels birth from hell And devils warp from heaven No one knew the truth When time fled into space And space into time None shelter it with concern When love seeks to blind the heart of the lonely one None forsee its path As the blinding of love unbind it self The legends of knights in shinning armor reincarnated The soul of saints rebirth And the blessing of the gods shone once again Such awe and splendour Hidden in the seed of love itself
Student,'Flashes of life' The winds blew the memories of the dead The past flashes like a train Emotions swelled to pain sadness and joy Familiar faces carved into the graves Something emerged triumphant The icy cold swept up in a torrent devouring the warm and lush air Like a man frozen with no feelings thoughts nor love
Student,They say there is nothing we cannot overcome in life What of times when steel of determination were cut open by the blade of love Fallen so many times to dark pits Hurt torn and shattered.
Student,It was her face which etched clearly in my mind
Student,Love present past and the future Where art thou I left my dreams and hopes As the light shimmer of memories To a new land I am there Smashing the mirror I knew there was no way back Ruins of past and present lay before me Am i to find the one who i love and who love me not in the midst of the sunless lands Where the wind seems an absent vacuum And the air tainted with death My home I do not know There seems not a presence of a smoke nor shadow AS i tread lifeless waste I found a charcoal sheet Upon it wrote ' July 2 Year 3210 '
Student,Love never dies a natural death.
Student,There were so many times When i look into her eyes but yet she shun them from me So many times Is there an end I knew i must leave But where Perhaps somewhere where I can find love and care or perhaps a dark corner where i can cry alone I do not know..
Student,Fatigue reverberate though the ear Deep lines of wrinkles carved in depth Dark lines embedded by the eyes Pensive thoughts swam in the hollow pool Influx of memories flooded like streams of river Yet tainted and impure it was Strands of white brushed softly against the wind And eyes faded to dark thoughts Where death stalks in the shadow Wisdom and knowledge dwindled into the vast ocean
Student,Standing by the window Watching the bright stars shine their light Seeing her face in my mind Listening to the song of the nightingale Feeling the soft caress of the wind Dwelling in solitude -- Pieces of puzzle Fixed on piece by piece I knew so many answers Yet I fear to face them -- Call me a liar a fool But I hear not of them If there was a chance to spin the wheels of time To reach the tunnel of past and present To staunch wound which bleed in my heart -- I would still say
Student,When I saw everything cumbling before me

Sports-Recreation,yes it has been awhile since i posted as i was occupied with actually doing things with people and escorting ryan (my friend who as he puts it is from florida but happens to live in kentucky) around town...there might be something to this social stuff...i will attempt to make up for this with renewed vigor or not.

Technology,'Sergei Torop was a traffic cop in the small Russian town of Minusinsk until 1989 when he announced that he was the son of God.
Technology,i think you may be putting much more thought into your analysis of the movie than was actually put into the script for attack of the clones or phantom menace.
Technology,something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: 'disappearing' vs. 'leaving a corpse' at the death of a jedi.
Technology,the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members: shannon erwin and johnathan 'better-late-than-never' shipley.

Technology,one final note (for now) on the marriage as solution issue (and yes i think salon is presenting an extreme view - shock) from what i have experienced in life (which is limited indeed) one of the best feelings one can experience is to see a person touch them and realize that no matter where you physically are that you are home.
Technology,i also read the article about marriage and while i believe it is valid that we need to create and maintain relationships outside of our primary romantic one there must be a reason why this desire for long-term bonding has consistently been a part of societal structures.
Technology,if you would like to have a better understanding of how i view life and the world- and god knows i know you do - i would recommend that you read 'notes from underground' by fyodor dostoevsky.
Technology,maybe someone in this circle who has a scientific background can explain to me why toxic sludge is good for fish.

BusinessServices,in the morning after being locked out of my room for the better part of the night khaos is in supreme attack mode.
BusinessServices,As I was going up the stair I met a man who wasn't there.

BusinessServices,Is it anti-social or even 'high maintenance' to refuse to leave the confines of your cool air conditioned basement apartment and to demand that anyone who wants to see you show up there when it's this hot and muggy outside What if I am in here with the temperature around 12 wearing wool socks and a sweat shirt
BusinessServices,Yes they changed my flight itinerary.

Education,just got offered a full time position up in Sharon as an ABA teacher and I am now working in my field full time and within an environment where everyday is a reward.
Education,You know those 'billboards' that you sometimes see in front of restaurants and businesses that offer a quote or something catchy to draw you in Well on a trip through Dighton to get to Somerset I came across such a 'billboard' in front of a church that stated 'The closer you live to God the smaller everything else appears.'
Education,well let's start the blog with a rundown of what happened this past weekend.
Internet,I am drinking a Balto Heroic Beer.
Internet,Today's update is brought to you by the letter O.
Internet,My gosh it's been two weeks.
Internet,I'm typing this in a new planning system.
Internet,It's eating my ribcage out to write this.
Internet,well it's been a disappointing week all around.
Internet,I'm not sure what's derailed my day more.
Internet,I've been playing with the colors.
Internet,I'm blogging today because it says in my planner that today I blog.
Sports-Recreation,Sexual nightmares NIGHTMARE #1 After a long night of making love the young guy rolled over pulled out a cigarette from his jeans and searched for his lighter.
Fashion,Yo yo yo...DJ is in the hizzy for rizzy.
Fashion,Make that two (2) diet cokes.
Fashion,Stoner I am honored by your presence.
Fashion,I am pleased to announce my arrival at Pandyland I am excited about my newfound freedom.
Fashion,I guess I can't seem to avoid trouble lately.
Fashion,I'm so excited and I just can't hide it I'm about to lose control and I think I like it.
Fashion,Forced into exile by the crap called Sasshole I bring you the next big thing on the Net: Pandyland.
Fashion,Sometimes I believe that cheaters prosper.
Fashion,Um...will you knit me a sweater I'm looking for a northeastern cabled fisherman's sweater style sweater (XL - sigh) in forest green.
Fashion,Duf Fer -- you are not sharing too much because I have no idea who those people are.
Fashion,I love my wife she is wonderful but in my nature is a tendency to have absurd crushes.
Fashion,Today was looking pretty grim until just a minute ago.
Fashion,Hey Panda - since you've had some near-misses with Bono around town maybe you'll have more luck with Peter Gabriel.
Fashion,Are they cheesy hash browns I like cheesy hash browns.
Fashion,Ive actually seen Panda do a duet of Up Where We Belong and I have to tell you it was truly inspiring.
Fashion,I think I will sing something inspirational like 'Up Where We Belong' or the theme song from 'The Great American Hero' (Believe it or not I'm walking on air...).
Fashion,HAL to boss: 'Hey Jac-kay baby I got ya money doncha worry Jac-kay.'
Fashion,I just went to Taco Bell with my boss and she tried to pimp me out to a pair of 18 year olds.
Fashion,I would like to sing 'Summer Wine' (the song that is on the 'Corrs Live on VH1' cd apparently Nancy Sinatra sang it) just like they do -- as a duet with Bono.
Fashion,Sign me up for the PBJ (Pandyland Burrito Jamboree).
Fashion,I think that everyone should have to sing a song at the first annual Pandyland Burrito Jamboree.
Fashion,Since I am coming to Minneapolis on the weekend of October 12th I think a Pandyland rendezvous is in order.
Fashion,Ball of confusion That's what the world is today Hey Hey So last night I get home from work thinking there is going to be this great anniversary celebration (what is the second anniversary anyway Tin Paper Cash I think it is cotton or china) and I find my wife drunk on Grain Belt Premium singing that Dave Edmunds song: 'I Knew the Bride When She Used to Rock and Roll' out of key at the top of her lungs.
Fashion,You'll have to ask the 'rents about the open bar plan since that's their gig.
Fashion,I feel like a loser that I wasnt in the short-story contest like everyone else though I had a nice weekend regardless.
Fashion,I haven't been able to post much lately.
Fashion,DJS you are right on the money about craphole.com...not only are their posts ridiculous-o but that idiot Sara thinks our site is the mock site that Mr. Crap had painstakingly made eons ago.
Fashion,I think I might have to wait to post my story on this here site.
Fashion,Shovelpants Stoner participated in the self same short story contest.
Fashion,Not a bad weekend on my end either.
Fashion,I have to say it was a good weekend.
Fashion,I have come up with a new 'workplace friendly' version of the Nelly song: 'Hot in Herrre.'
Fashion,Yeah Bobo was a real 'clown' alright.
Fashion,Okay...reading my TV post I came off as kind of a suckerhead and everyone knows that's not how I do...so.
Fashion,I'm so glad you all voted off Bobo Le Clown.
Fashion,Wow I didn't think I would get such a rebuttal.
Fashion,Okay Panda let me clear the air about the whole TV thing.
Fashion,I just caught a bit of Bono on Oprah this morning.
Fashion,I couldn't watch more than 2 minutes of Fastlane.
Fashion,I have to go to Cleveland...
Fashion,Billygoat comes back from Cleveland today.
Fashion,To all you suckerheads who don't live in Chicago: BONO IS IN TOWN TODAY.
Fashion,Special thanks to Stoner for performing a vigilante rodent inspection earlier this week (she gave us the all-clear).
Fashion,Hey...I got no shame I'd do it.
Fashion,That sounds delightful Even though I never met the Shovel I think I would thoroughly enjoy seeing him get his toenails painted.
Fashion,That's funny -- I was just thinking the Pandyland staff should go out for manis and pedis when Panda is in town.
Fashion,Bright Idea Of The Day: I think our Pandyland blogging staff should meet for a delicious Chipotle burrito someday.
Fashion,I just overheard someone say we had female problems yesterday but then I realized they actually said we had email problems yesterday.
Fashion,Panda - your Bill story is classic and informative.
Fashion,DJS I like to read your Soft Drink site.
Fashion,That story sounds oddly familiar...Billygoat and I thought my silverfish were coming from Bill the guy across the hall from me.
Fashion,For the record our apartment is spotless (except for the peanut butter that is probably now all over the place thanks to our old-fashioned mousetraps).
Fashion,Well while we're on the subject... My girlfriend is a clean-freak.
Fashion,So I was thinking of visiting Hal and Stoner in Minneapolis but now it seems I may have to reconsider.
Fashion,RED ALERT Hal and I have a mouse in our apartment.
Fashion,DJS probably better that I missed lunch.
Fashion,HAL: That stuff about the drunken slob was comedy gold.
Fashion,I will be in NYC all next week - yet again I have to be in NY on September 11th.
Fashion,After that 1-1/2 hour Marathon Medley (more like the Sweeney Sisters on crack) we finally got to the winner....the people have spoken: And the people chose the 20-year-old Texan cocktail waitress - Kelly Clarkson All kidding aside having been involved in choral music for most of my life I've heard good singers as well as really bad singers...and I have to say - Kelly is one of the best I've heard for someone her age.
Fashion,I am very surprised (and disappointed) to see all you hard-core U2 fans have not even mentioned the fact that U2 is coming out with its second 'Best Of' collection in November.
Fashion,A very ill person has given the Walgreens pharmacy the wrong phone number Hal and I keep getting their automated calls informing this person that their prescription is ready.
Fashion,Billygoat has officially moved out of his place and out of Chicago.
Fashion,I had the honor of golfing with Hal and Bobo le Clown this weekend.
Fashion,Oh man...I miss all the cool dirt while I'm out of the office including the cake stampede.
Fashion,I just had the most terrifying experience.
Fashion,Today I had a terrifying experience.
Fashion,Yesterday I had a terrifying experience.
Fashion,Dear Duffer What happened yesterday Signed Stoner
Fashion,Have you ever had one of those days where some things go incredibly right (you get an unforeseen pay raise no where near your review date and you get a traffic ticket thrown out) and some things go incredibly wrong too (you're sick your company loses a key account there are struggles at home) Well I had such a day yesterday.
Fashion,Stoner Congratulations I can't wait to read your stuff and I really can't wait for that point in the future when I can say 'I knew her when...'
Fashion,Um - I gave that magazine an idea for another story and guess what.
Fashion,Greetings Pandyland As Panda mentioned I'm currently in NYC staying with my bro/sis-in-law (aka 'my peeps') for the week.
Fashion,Just to let y'all know - HAL is here in NYC We just went to lunch.
Fashion,Stoner: I'm so proud of you I just don't know what else to say.
Fashion,That sounds like some lame-o joke off of a Laffy Taffy wrapper.
Fashion,A bird that buries its head in mashed potatoes
Fashion,I guess I need to ask: What
Fashion,What do you get when you cross a turkey and an ostrich
Fashion,And to have a hostile dentist on your hands is a very dangerous situation indeed
Fashion,Panda Bear I did not know you were a dentist Signed Duf
Fashion,It's about time I openly bashed the company I work for.
Fashion,Hey kids...rock n' roll rock on...etc.
Fashion,Why can't you do it Why can't you set your monkey free All it takes is a little doing.
Fashion,Anyone who knows me pretty well knows that I love monkeys.
Fashion,Burn Junkie This morning I found myself thinking about the summer vacation I took with my family in August.
Fashion,I just have one question: If you have a regular site and a sister site is that incest
Fashion,Hiya Kids... Nah I didn't go into hiding I just decided to shut ol' Soft Drink down for a multitude of reasons.
Fashion,I think DJS had to go into hiding because of that whole fiasco with the Chipotle Mafia.
Fashion,DJS what happened to Soft Drink
Fashion,Im running into a little trouble here this morning.
Fashion,Little Purple Pill/A Guy from Nebraska/I'm in love I'm pretty sure I have acid reflux disease...it was only a matter of time.
Fashion,Hey thanks I had a great time on Saturday even if it was a bit low-key.
Fashion,Hey guys DJS - Nice work with the links and photo page Me likey.
Fashion,Why is everyone so quiet today.... Delayed-onset PBJ hangover
Fashion,If we go to Milwaukee it has to be the Pandyland Bratwurst Jamboree.
Fashion,To quote Bjork: 'Sometimes the things I do astound me.'
Fashion,Abort Abort Abort Someone already took pandyland as a Yahoo user name....So our official e-mail is: pandylandblog@yahoo.com Pandyland members e-mail me at annie_hultgren@yahoo.com if you would like the password.
Fashion,Panda...I'm on it like a Jimmy-Cap.
Fashion,Regarding The Milwaukee Pandyland Gala: it's really hard to find body-building midgets on this short notice.
Fashion,So now that the pics are 'live' on Ofoto.com who needs Admin rights to put 'em up on this site (or at least via link) DJS Are you up to the task The no-links look of this site has become a bit mundane.
Fashion,Props to Panda for the great pics You'd think by this point in my life I'd know enough not to drink near flashbulbs but alas I am naive.
Fashion,At its height the internet like a vibrant democracy provides a forum for the free exchange of ideas.
Fashion,Okay I'm only admitting this because they are gone now but I used to have plantars warts all over the bottoms of my feet.
Fashion,I'd like to have another Jamboree soon as I don't remember much of the last one... sigh.
Fashion,She's gone for the day so I'll sneak to her cube and eyeball the situation.
Fashion,I thought knowing the fate of the drink would be enough but it only triggered more questions: 1.
Fashion,I must know -- did the drink make it to CK 2's desk intact
Fashion,To quote DJS: Duf Fer's PBJ1 play-by-play is 'COMEDY PLATINUM.'
Fashion,Pandyland Burrito Jamboree (PBJ1 - to those in the know): Would You Rather read a really long post about the PBJ1 or be forced to read bunghole for a week Where to begin...
Fashion,Warning There are jokes on specially marked Diet Coke bottles.
Fashion,News Flash: Duf Fer and I just got back from a quick jaunt to Rainbow Foods where I was asked to pick up some treats for a training session.
Fashion,I'm thinking Lynard Skynard (in honor of America's Sweetheart Reese): In Birmingham they love the guv-nah (ew ew ew) And we all did what we could do Not watergate it does not botha me Does your conscience botha you now tell me true.
Fashion,Roy Sounds like a Grade A suckerhead.
Fashion,Speaking of Roy I sent that guy an invite and he never posted a damn thing here.
Fashion,Please tell me you were able to fit Ben into your luggage.
Fashion,I just looked at the weather and it's supposed to be 30 frickin degrees in Minneapolis this weekend.
Fashion,I want to clear up a misconception.
Fashion,Why is it that when we write something cheesy in a greeting card we sometimes feel compelled to add the words just kidding I just did that as if my coworker would think I was serious when I wrote birthdays are so great you should have them more often For one thing isnt even possible.
Fashion,Stoner to satisfy your love of rap and my love of duets we should sing a little diddy that combines both.
Fashion,Two 'rritos (I thought they needed a nickname) and Lil' Sickie WILL be there I assure you.
Fashion,I'm thinking two burrito and four drink minimum on friday.
Fashion,Wow...my reputation as a crank caller is spreading.
Fashion,Now that the P-town excitement has died down I can focus my energy on gearing up for the Pandyland Burrito/Karaoke Jamboree In other news our crazy neighbors still have anti-window-washer paraphernalia on their door.
Fashion,I spent last weekend in Portland with Stoner and Mrs. Headrick.
Fashion,Pandyland turned Haiku Town... TGIF Thank God it's Friday A burrito would be nice Stiff drink sounds better Cancelled Wedding Picked up the invites Can't reuse those things - dammit.
Fashion,Five Things by Fer Duf: 1.
Fashion,Panda B: Yeah I'm guessing your talking about the ass-play scene with Ralphie and Janice.
Fashion,Some of my personal drama has died down a bit since last Friday so I thought I'd come here to Pandyland for a little respite.

Arts,For those of you who are wondering why Bill Gates would stop at Illinois before traveling on to Carnegie-Mellon MIT Cornell and Harvard here are a few reasons why he came here (and why you should come here too): -Microsoft hires more employees from Illinois than from any other university -Tim French goes to school at Illinois -Illinois is a fun word to pronounce -orange and blue are great school colors (if you're not colorblind) -did I mention that Tim French goes to Illinois -there is a low Icelandic population so moms are safe from young men here -bowl cuts are available here -mullets are NOT available here (sorry Adam and Steffen) Alright so while the first reason is probably the only reason Bill Gates came here you should all consider a visit to the Illinois prairie.

Biotech,Yea IM finally back after a good long clearing walk and rest in the shade of the trees as I right this I'm eating my dinner so I cant do much about legend yet but if you read this before any link appear underneath have a complain at me on MSN messenger if you have it Baldy_III@hotmail.com well after a bit of the old searching I've come up with the old nothing I think my spree of finding interesting site is over as all I can find now is of site saying do vampires exist and someone else saying oh yes I'm one you'll believe me even though I have no idea what I'm talking about and just want to sound cool well to those people I say you bloody twat it make you sound like a complete idiot or is the just because you can't hide you true nature and you really are an idiot.
Biotech,or Its Compleate Turd if you go by ICT as you can proably see i'm rather annoyed with my IT though i shouldn't be its more the terrible teaching and lack of some of the stuff we got asked being anywhere in the revision book bloody usless thing.
Biotech,Well today's been once again a boring day and I'm back to normal I think infact today's been so boring I have absolulty nothing to right about apart from how just before I wrote this I played a game of Age of Empires with Akers whom was beating me Thoroughly as I only had a small band of cavalry and made the game last so long he had to go and I won by default (yea bless you whoever invented default).
Biotech,Well its the day after and I've spent most of the day up to now either sleeping or out in the wood on the hill.

Biotech,Well today I have done nothing on the vampire Lycan front but have been side tracked looking at a Kurt Cobain conspiracy theory site which you can see here also a game of Age of Empires which then crashed making it a small waste also took me of my intended target.
Biotech,Today has once again been quite predictably boring.
Biotech,well the day although not over yet has yeilded nothing of any intrest and i very much doubt it will.
Biotech,I have finally returned for my perilous journey to the UCI and I believe I have come out better off (not financially of course… grumbles about price of bus fare and cinema tickets).
Biotech,only 13 days to my birthday oh no some unlucky thing will happen to me well it wasn't getting pulled out of the libary while skiving a lesson so thats ok i cant belive it 3 people who have never skived and you never think would did kinda surprising though hmmm 10 people are missing from a lesson they were here earlyer i wonder where they've gone.
Biotech,decided to do this blog early as it makes up for the lateness that i wrote the last one though some peoples are a day late tut tut.
Biotech,Hello the few to zero people who read these well I decided that if nobody reads these things Which being though I know that should prove to Ben that at least 1 person does I might as well wright my own in order to pass away the time as I am now so constantly bored.
Biotech,just a quick blog so its done for today i'll have to do it properly tommorow.
Biotech,Hello thar mayteys today thar be pirates on the deck As there be a half day at bill to contend with.
Biotech,yea today I've avoided all form of work more or less except having to go get my brother from school so I've had a lot of spare time with which i have probably used to some good firstly though i will speak or type in more detail about the last few days as the blogs have been sadly lacking in there appearance first thing i can remember is the half-dream which took me to a church through the graveyard i went there in real life later to find out all the graves were in the same place as in the dream as i stepped inside i awoke with a feeling like when you touch a TV that has recently been turned off after being on a long time inside my head which was so strange i had to write it down.
Biotech,well firstly an apology for the last 2 days I've been very busy with all sorts of stuff and haven't had chance to blog.
Biotech,And i'm laughing myself so silly.
Biotech,Now on to today after just posting for yesterday.
Biotech,I'm most humbly apologies Mr blogger dashboard oh and anyone who wanted to read this yesterday for yesterday my internet broke in a fashion I couldn't be arsed to fix right before the time I wanted to blog.
Biotech,I'm bored so I'm going to write a blog.
Biotech,todday has been a day of many filmsas we have anumber of rented DVD's in my home at the momentt i decided to spend this day watching them so it is not that i have seen little today it is that it's verry difficult to write about films you've watched i wright this during a break between die another day which i just finished wayching and somthing else which i haven't decided on yet well this is all i can muster at the moment so i guess this page will next change tommorow.
Biotech,Well I just watched bullet proof monk so I have a kind of monk philosophy in my head it was a decent film but a bit crap at the same time in a way I can't be bothered to explain right now and I wont remember about it tomorrow.
Biotech,yea today you get the rare sight of one blog in tow days or perhaps that should be the other way round anyhow that RS exam definitely put a downer on my spirits then it rained great its fine weather until we leave the exam obviously God is punishing me for doing so badly but oh well I've got a website full of new stuff to get finishing there's that and that I'm indoors not that I'm particularly bothered by the rainquite refreshing anyhow with a feeling of night descending with the rain clouds I'm begging to regain some of my sanity after wrighting about some group of people I frankly don't care about I'm simply glad I don't have to ever touch that subject ever again WOOO.
Biotech,Yea I dunno what it is about today but I'm feeling kind off up and happy this morning well if Ben's listening to kerrang I can bet he's happy Rasmus is on lol anyhow what's with saying I like them I only said 'at least on person will listen to it' when my mum got the album for on song I don't think however this means I like them I mean WTF I don't care to much if they're on anyhow oh well ill put that behind me well to continue my resticted blog yesterday yea creating website one thing that does make me quite happy its fun and one day I hope to have some 'real content to put into one' perhaps a company one.
Biotech,YEY a free day well spent i think this blog ain't gonna be to be painfully restricted as i have a lot more to wright than i can be bothered to part 1 i've started learning Visual basic but have had alot of other things to do so i've got as far as leaning how to use the wizzards (not verry far in other words) but it looks to be quite intresting i think i need to go out and come back to it again later as i get bored of reading tecnical books after a short while as im sure everyone else does.
Biotech,YEA another song lyric for a title during the meanwhilest How ya'll doing hope you are all doing well and planning a toughly worthwhile day tomorrow as there are no exams at all wooo.
Biotech,from where I see the ships afar hmmm yes anyhow today's been like a tomato soup excitingly boring I've had no exam yea but I've had to stay in all day housekeeping oh well its definitely seemed like I've been living on my own since about 10 last night when almost everyone went to a tent warming party or rather they slept in the tent in the back garden so I got all the house except the very top room all to myself this was then followed up by waking up at about 10;30 this morning to soon enough find the house empty again and it's been such until now and probably until later as well.
Biotech,yea after a perpetualy borring 2 exams i feel for you all we don't you just hate school but fortuanaly if the school reads my english paper they might get an idea of what is to come i i get back on there computers damm these last few weeks have been full of cool tecnical computer stuff now hat i look back i relise that now heres a short list of things i have leant to do (because i dont have anything else to do today) 1)get free pay 2 veiw channels on sky 2)use net support to gain other peoples passwords 3)some basic ways of gaining a password for a website 4)how to use a hex editor 5)how to bet you all at microsoft pinball 6) some dos promt commands i dindt know existed i know i shouldn't brag about these or say i know how to do them but i've just got verry excited about the implications of somthing i just learned about and its pretty exciting if it works andhow my bro (whos about to go to the pit i just crawled ot off)and dad just got back from learning about the wonders ofour school network and i think i've been subtuly informed its crap.
Biotech,today not held verry much for me haven't even thought about much most of the day i spent listening to music sleeping and playing ryl which has been a restfull conbernation as i feel i've overloaded my brain recently with stuff i haven't bothered to put in my blog as it isn't really stuff i'd like to share with anyone yet.
Biotech,hello again everyone sorry about missing yesterday although it makes no difference when you read about what I’ve done anyway I think its something that I can even be bothered to write these when its just sowing up how I live to any random person who comes across it.
Biotech,a tiring day after both English and geography exams both subjects which I hate stupid fate.
Biotech,hello today I've taken to wrigting in html form after spending most of my spare time (which wasn't that long as a slept most of this morning) on hack this site but also taking to the political enthic side pretty boring I know some people will think and would rather lean to hack but that's not the point I'm looking for knowlage and there's a whole lot of people out there with it (just not many in comparison with those who don't) but any how I had fun started learning a world of new stuff cant say I'm any good at it yet though.
Biotech,well another days gone past and a major highlight of today has been two mass nose bleeds while the blood is an itresting liquid its rather annoting when its streaning from your nose instead of someones neck.
Biotech,Yea replace bug with exam and dead with burning YEY anyhow hope your day weren't as bad as mine 2 Exams why mush I face such torments fortunately both were reasonably easy though a stream running from my nose and eyes stinging like a thousand bees didn't help curse you hayfever why cant you be worse like heart attcks so i wouldn'd have to do exams or lighter like nothing so i can concentrate on what im doing well after rather a feverish day imfeeling like even nature is against me oh well today i've discovered that tommorow there is to be a transit of venus accross the sun starting sometime in the morning so if you've got nothing better to do set up ur digital camaras and try and catch it though you'll need some kind of filter to do it.
Biotech,Well today went pretty well and I believe I've got some mental capacity back and its a good job to what with 2 exams tomorrow sorry for everyone else who has and dang you if you only have science.
Biotech,IT HAS BEEN UBER BORING AGAIN (I decided I'd use uber) well once again it seems nothing will ever happen even though I've been out looking I've seen no one special the only can think of nothing new for the site given up waiting in chat room as nobody visits me boohoo.
Biotech,Being as though my (kind of dreams) have been quite interesting and my day today has not I decided today I would write up some of my dreams do I remember them even tough their pretty stupid dreams in the most part ill write them anyway.
Biotech,Read that off the back of someones t-shirt at my little bro's final assembly that i just went to kind of made me think off the legions of those dubbed chavs by us 'different' people who dont realy follow anything or anyone except a common goal which usualy contains anarcy even if you dont think it does to some degree it will.
Biotech,Hello there everyone who reads my blog and possibly the weirdo who left a comment ill talk about this a minute while I remember after being show it by Ben I think firstly wow a comment secondly I collapse in a fit of laughter.
Biotech,in which case i've been doing alot of denying recently which is strange.
Biotech,Hi eveybodys (small crowd) Hi Dr Bald today has definitely been considerably better than the whole of the weekend put together which defiantly shows how crap the weekend was.
Biotech,hello again everyone in not feeling to well recently realy drained dunno why just do i even had to sleep the other day but not last night and as a result i found if you have paramount 2 chanel 128 on sky dont know about any other providers at 10 05 with gives you 10 miniutes from now you will see monty pythons flying curcus with i have been depived of (boo hoo).
Biotech,Hi everybody I decided on a colour change sorry I missed yesterday but blogger was playing up and it seemed to have not been working.
Biotech,Once again hello you'll probably be glad to know i have given up saying everything twice twice i no longer say everything lol.
Biotech,that repeat i am to going now or at least everything i now type happens twice.
Biotech,is no sleep what a good idea.
Biotech,Howdy I'm bored already so I'm going to blog even if its going to be crap.

Advertising,yesterday was not a perfect day to begin with.
Advertising,My Chub webteam particularly Gemuk Chub thank you for inviting me to somehow write my two cents worth in this blog though i doubt that it would amount to anything but at least hmmmm...why do we like to say at least this at least that is it something heriditary or we r just being too freaking polite and doesn't want to sound too show offy when the real emphasise is obviously on the at least thingie and it seems we simply settle for the 'at least' when we didnt manage to achieve anything how contradictory.
Advertising,To Lyndon: Pretense I suppose everything is a bed of roses when you first met then the 'attraction graph' goes down.

Advertising,Hi there I just got reading the previous articles.
Advertising,hello again alll how you all doing actually i was thinking of what rozmanshah blog the other day and it got me thinking hey actually what is my root my real root come to think of it i am not sure what it is but then i do have to ask something to all of you do all of you know why we are we this question have been ask before so many time and everyone have they own different understanding of it u see before i was like everyone else i try to deny what i am feeling toward other chubby men i cover them up by saying that i just admire them but the truth is that he is taste(duh) well i keep telling myself that until one day i finally come to the point where i was dreaming of romantic moment with that person and at the end i really make up with him that the simple stories of my root how i finally accecpt myself as GAY but then there are other thing to worry about wut about your family ermmm... i got into that situation too i don't know if i have ever tell you guys this actually my family know that i am gay at first they were like really sad but then they kindda accecpt it i have try to hide it from them but finally they find out by them self i told them about my current bf and they accecpt it as well ask him everytime my mom call they are like sister(elo you guyz never even meet yet) hihihi well i am kindda glad that i manage to get through all of it with the help of friends my family and my BF we finaly kindda answer the big question( which is in our own understanding ) why we are we because we are human and no human is perfect but we try our best to live happy as our self and they is nothing wrong we that and if anyone think otherwise then Dude you got a problem Totaly big one too Dude take care everyone~~ CHUBMASHIMARO :-
Advertising,i havent written for quite some time not that i was bz or something like that (I am eternally bz with work anyway) it's just that i found that writing for this blog proved to be quite a hard challenge not everyday we experienced encounters and not every day we resort into slutness.
Advertising,hi all how are you well this time mashimaro is back but with a sad story some of you guys know where i study rite well i currently doing my practical there too i meet up with one of the patient which i was going to monitor his progress during the sugery he had to undergo that week he is a daddy chub with 168cm tall 105kg and 44 inch waist i know this since i read his folder but is not that he was chub and all(although is was one of the main part of it) but it is because he is this kind and friendly guy that never stop smiling.
Advertising,Hi you alll mashimaro is back again and this time I got like a few stuff to put in the blog well is being a great week last week went for the gathering is was cool It makes me realize that I havent being clubbing for such a long time ok well the was some comment about me when I enter the channel about all the blog I wrote some comments are constructive but some are destructive Well I take it all as a reminder and motivation for me one thing though people actually told me that it cant be that someone could have so much encounter plus at a young age like me Well to tell you guys the truth actually you guys will find an encounter almost every single day but an encounter will never be so direct You guys must see all the small detail that follow for example a few day ago I was walking to the caf during my lunch break Suddenly I realize that well someone was following me But I ignore it thinking it might just be my imagination but then I realize that the guy was still following me from behind so I took the courage to say hi And ask him why is he following me He was quite a while and then he say that he was lost and was following me because he wanted to ask for direction Ok for you all you probably say that he was right He was just trying to ask for direction But think of this Of all the people around there why me Why did he follow me from the second floor till the caf At that time he have plenty of time to ask someone else for direction For me that was an encounter although he was only a cub but he has a cute face Just nice lerr So sometime when you guys wanted to make you life more exciting all the little thing that we most probally ignore just for once think that it does really matter From a small smile(respon tu) to a sharp stare (taste kat kiter ker) or just a cute comment example: you ni cute ler ( mak aii Bertambah kembang mak dibuatnyer) hihihihihi ok you guys gotto go now but a new blog is coming soon so be patient ok (yeah that mean you too Sir Cloud) to take care you all mashimaro

Law,I've done very well this week - only 1 really late night at work I haven't exactly been shirking my duties at least I've been trying to devote some long-overdue time to some of my charitable activities - oh and having a facial Wow Did I need it I was buffed and rubbed by Anna - delightful wee thing with mad Bjorkish bunches - I decided against the hi-tech lifting doobrey My looks may be fading but I'm not ready for that yet I opted for the deep cleanse instead.
Law,I decided at 3.30pm today that I would resign from my Charity position - I had not even started to look at Friday's post let alone today's and my in-tray was higher than my washing pile at home Something had to give and my charitable indulgences seemed the obvious choice I rang the new Chair-in-Waiting and told her I would be taking a few months sabbatical - I meant it I came off the phone all proud of myself at having finally said 'no' - not an expression I've used often as a 30-something single mum I went to rescue my carat 6.30pm from the multi-storey with every intention of going back to the office but the further away I got from it the more I decided the work would still be there tomorrow - so I started to drive home and before I knew it I was in the car park of the Baptist Church - venue for the AGM Well I had invited the speaker would be rude not to show my face I'm pleased I did - the proceedings started perfunctorily - I found myself agreeing to remain as Publicity Officer (joke - I write the odd editorial for the paper and run a Ball or 2) I could have kicked myself after all my brave words on the phone about being too busy but then I never could say no But my speaker What a delight A localish-ish Funeral Director Not your normal choice of bon vivant but an absolute pearl Funny compelling witty discreet compassionateand extremely respectful to the objects of his dialogue (and dialogue it was with audience participation encouraged) He has a book out in a couple of weeks - ' YoursEventually' 120 stories randomly collected over 30 years as a funeral director - if his delivery of half a dozen of those anecdotes tonight are anything to go by he will have you in raptures and tears for the small price of £6.99 Mark Tyack He'll be big - you saw it here first
Law,Well that was a pleasnt weekend.
Law,I wasn't exactly skiving off early tonight - I mean ok so I went to the hairdressers at 5 o'clock but he is a client so it was just like I was still working reeaaallyy Albeit whilst having my roots done and a few blonde highlights dotted here and there (and he did it for free on account of that fact that I was still working) He's lovely my hairdresser - Danny - handsome funny and unstereotypically straight - what's more he's newly single and gets changed into his football strip to blow-dry my hair And I don't even have to pay him to do it he's just getting ready to go straight to his 6-a-side game as soon as he's finished de-HattieJacquesing me - when one of his mates or his equally dishy (and also remarkably unhomosexual) brother are there too passing the masking papers or holding the ceramic straighteners I can think of nowhere better than to relax from the rigours of a stressful week.
Law,I'm really pleased I did as I was told for once and stayed away from the office all weekend.
Law,Blissful day Slept 'til about 11 having spent far too long talking to a would-be accountant from the North West and a very unusual Irish giant - it was mad - my son would have been shocked - I certainly was Anyway I lay in bed for the entire Jonathan Ross programme reading - not my new novel but a foodie magazine got all inspired and headed for my temple St Tesco as soon as I'd deloused myself in the bathroom.
Law,I did it I pulled the rabbit out of the hat - again God I'm proud of myself sometimes.
Law,Horrible day Yuk Yuk Started badly - didn't get out of the wrong side of bed just got out too late Thank goodness my secretary is trained to give me a wake up call when I don't appear within half an hour of my ETA I finally did battle with the dreaded Sasser worm last night and had a bit of a cyber fest into the bargain - well it was his birthday and he is very cute Anyway the birds were up before I was even tucked up - must remember not to do that on a school night again But it was fun.
Law,I finally did it Got off the sofa threw on some clothes (not my first choice but they were in the wash) and went to meet a man A proper real living breathing man I was really nervous - much more so than before an exam - I sail through those and the examiner never cares how huge your arse is I spent ages faffing about and running backwards and forwards to the loo - CM was getting really frustrated 'cos he wanted dropping off at his mates and I couldn't tell him where I was going After I'd looked in the mirror for the 20th time he finally screamed 'For Goodness sake you look beautiful and you're only going to the flipping office' We'd arranged to meet at a tourist attraction close to my office.
Law,You would think given that I only live next door my mother would have been able to give me a little advance notice that my new patio door was being fitted today - it's not a lot to ask surely.
Law,I was reeeeaaaallllly dancing last night.
Law,It's my First Knickers Day The anticipation has been immense - what would they be like who would they be from was I wrong in ruling out dental-floss-esque styles(anyone that knows me will be siding with my better instinct on that) So - white lacy hipster midi French styley Very nice actually - and as I haven't done any washing this week - arrived just in the Knick() of time from Julie in Gloucestershire - I have a sneaking suspicion she might be a friend of my cousin Jennie - the lazy buggers in Hull haven't done it yet Gosh I bet you are wondering what on earth I'm going on about I know discussing my underwear is a bit extreme even for me.
Law,I've missed my secretary -she's been poorly sick for 3 days now - I've just had Ling to do my bidding - and she did great for the first 2 days - but today I gave her my completions to do - only 10 today and all purchases (bar one which was a very straightforward sale) - they were all t'd up and couldn't have been an easier day to start - she did well - but she thought she did outstandingly well - she was smugger than ever this afternoon and kept bustling into my office every 5 flipping minutes - I shut my door for a reason being 'I'm busy - I vant to be alone' - Jacquie knows that instinctively - Ling obviously sees it as a challenge - or an invitation to irritate me as much as possible - she was outstanding at that So tonight I was home just after 8pm - had a good long chat with Eva - God she gave me some great material for my book - then Jack came home and went online - I fell asleep - only just woken up (3.45am) - and I've missed the Throb - means I've got to wait til Sunday at the earliest now - and I'll need an early pre-school night then Bugger But I did have some fun with that cute solicitor before I left work - dinner is now just a few emails away - I can feel it Oh and I went shopping in an extended lunch hour - get me having a break on a Friday I could get used to Ling after all - tried on loads of tops in the sales - and the only ones that fitted were 14s and then some were a bit baggy Didn't find the perfect corset-style top I was after but got a very acceptable scoop neck chiffon number which will look great with my new leather skirt tomorrow night.
Law,My uber-efforts at work are paying off - down to my last large pile of files to work on - but it has more to do with the fact that the strain has finally taken it's toll on my secretary who is currently nursing a nasty rash enlarged glands and a puffy face - I've told her to stay at home as long as it takes - I already have a propensity to all those traits and don't need any added assistance from my assistant.
Law,I picked one of the best ever matches to miss by all accounts.
Law,I must be the only person not watching the England-Croatia match judging by the groans and cheers I can hear from the pubs outside the office - and they are all quite a way off so I dread to think what is happening out there.
Law,Why do the weekends go so quickly and why do I never seem to achieve any of the things I plan to do I just about manage to do the washing give the place a very very quick once over and then it's Sunday night again and I have to think about getting up early.

Publishing,A rare midweek entry given that it being a rather grey and uninspiring Friday morning here at work my thoughts are less on this afternoons transmittal meeting and more on the gig to whit (a) why am I putting myself through this appalling ordeal (b) will the A & R men of Europe converge upon us (somewhat unlikely yes) and (c) would we benefit from some kind of hilarious / arch costume to project us into the NME's 50 great bands who look exactly like The White Stripes list And how shall I perfect my Detroit twang Ah well never mind.
Publishing,One week to go now; last nights rehearsal was great - bashing out the set and picking holes in our selection; deciding to finish with a combination of Andy's newest song (a lilting tom-rich drumbeat and a cheeky bassline) and our smoking song (which basically consists of forty seconds of discordance and shouting) and thinking that sounds great thanks.

Biotech,Man talk about a lot of weird occurrences this week...
Sports-Recreation,Maybe I'm strange but right this minute I'm sitting here crying.
Sports-Recreation,Why does waking up an hour earlier than usual make my day seem 18 hours longer Better yet why does that stupid woodpecker think my apartment building is a good place to tear into at 8am Every goddamned Sunday that motherfucker shows up at the worst damned time of day.
Sports-Recreation,Well a non-decision was my decision on that drama reported last week.
Sports-Recreation,For those of you wondering about my dramatic last few days well that hasn't changed at all.
Sports-Recreation,First off I'm leaving my last entry up here a little longer because I'm not one to actually post daily and I don't want any of you to miss anything (because I know you think it's SO important except not).
Sports-Recreation,I should just stop going to the mailbox.
Sports-Recreation,This is a rant very similar to a rant I posted over at Looking Good but I thought I'd repeat it over here you know seeing as this is my journal and I can do with it what I want.
Sports-Recreation,Here's something I'm less than impressed with.
Sports-Recreation,Just a little rant out of me today.
Sports-Recreation,Happy birthday Jamie Guess what you're still older than I am My god you're 24 What on earth are you gonna do now geezer Alright prepare yourself for me whining.
Sports-Recreation,Ah the wonders of college and all it's group-work bullshit.
Sports-Recreation,Ah the one year anniversary of my ultimate decision to get the hell out of a bad situation and come home.
Sports-Recreation,I'm having one of those days.
Sports-Recreation,Someone told me I should post all of my work escapades because they're funny reading so I took her advice and here's the latest installment.
Sports-Recreation,Happy Birthday (tomorrow) Janel Damn I feel old.
Sports-Recreation,Yet again things got a little too comfortable for us.
Sports-Recreation,So I got some bad news today.
Sports-Recreation,Woo Summer is here Thank god Okay excessive use of exclamation points stops now.
Sports-Recreation,I had something else all ready to post here.
Sports-Recreation,I got this poem in the mail today.
Sports-Recreation,Whoa Three times in less than seven days Must be some sort of record don't you think.
Sports-Recreation,I put some more hate items on the front page.
Sports-Recreation,Yeah I'm clearly sucking at this journal thing for May.
Sports-Recreation,Looks as though I've been neglecting this website doesn't it That's because that is exactly what has been happening.
Sports-Recreation,Ah well I'm back from my weekend with the family.
Sports-Recreation,Remember how I said things didn't feel right yesterday Must have been a premonition as to what was to come for later in the day.
Sports-Recreation,I added two new hate items on the front page.
Sports-Recreation,Hey I've been away for a while (again).
Sports-Recreation,I'm all kinds of amused today.
Sports-Recreation,Alright the birthday is over and surprisingly I had a pretty good day.
Tourism,Back to work....After DMB....Same ole same ole.
Tourism,Ok...So maybe I won't give out details on my rage.
Tourism,I am a ball of rage.
Tourism,I'm becoming a depressive alcoholic again.
Tourism,Apparently I'm going through one of my I NEED TO GET OUT OF TOWN phases.
Transportation,Life is truly a wondrous thing when the right people are involved.
Transportation,What little I know of where my life has been and where it will be going can be summed up in one small phrase... Well it will come to me eventually.
Transportation,Before we were married I wrote my wife a poem called Looking Back for an anniversary gift.
Transportation,Here is a bit more in the continuing saga about my Tuba which I am now in the process of polishing.
Transportation,When I bought my Tuba I simply needed something that would see me through the weekend.
Transportation,There seems to be this strange and unmistakable uneasiness that has come over me of late.
Transportation,I tell you I am going through withdrawals.
Transportation,Until I get to a few of the things that have kept me occupied of late my brother Nick graciously gave me permission to place here this post of events from my family's recent trip to northern Michigan to retrieve my Grandma's remaining items at the old house in the woods.
Transportation,Corey and Christy were at Spencerville church this morning.
Transportation,Quick report the kids are doing what I would term a very good (bordering on great) job with this musical.
Transportation,Quick update: I snuck in 10 minutes each on tuba trombone and trumpet this afternoon.
Transportation,Another good question: How often would Der Chor perform per month The more churches we represent (i.e.
Transportation,Reminder: Jan Wall from Spencerville Academy has asked us to play with her band for church at Triadelphia on May 15.
Transportation,Here's what I'm aware of at the moment in case anyone wants to co-ordinate with us this weekend.
Transportation,Hey Daniel thank you so much for including the warms ups.
Transportation,Corey your pledge has been heard (received read) and witnessed.
Transportation,David it sounds like a good beginning.
Transportation,Progress on practice is slow but steady: two 5-minute sessions Wednesday evening and a 10-minute session Thursday morning.
Transportation,How chic to be referred to as 'spice'
Transportation,What sort of music would Der Chor sing Would it be standard fair or high church What sort of denominations of churches if any are in mind What would the frequency of guest spots be for Der Chor What would a typical service look like that included Der Chor Would there be a collection of appropriate responses Would this be purely vocal or a musical combo Just thought I would throw these out for a start.
Transportation,I just scanned the rest of the blogs and i will try to read them more thourougly tomorrow.
Transportation,Der Chor is a choir concept.
Transportation,I don't know yet but I know that it calls for at least two flutes.
Transportation,I concur with David’s kudos to Danny for setting up this forum.
Transportation,I enjoy Daniel's philosophy of getting things done.
Transportation,I'm still trying to figure that out myself.
Transportation,I'm starting this web-log after discussions at our Triadelphia Low Brass rehearsal this evening.
Transportation,Ashton Family: Sabbath afternoon is taken starting around 3:30 as Danny has to head to HVA to play in a brass quintet there which should wrap up around 6:30.
Transportation,Yesterday i missed practice but i worked for about 20 min on wed. Did some playing of the transposed music and worked on the warm-up exercise.
Transportation,I am available on both days..... Wes
Transportation,Hey looks like i will not be here on the 15th... but the 29th looks good.
Transportation,Jan Wall asks: The Academy band is trying to put together a couple of pieces for Senior Graduation Sabbath at Spencerville.
Transportation,I have already noticed improvement in my husband's trombone performance.
Transportation,First i must admit I was a bit reluctant to 'give up' the 'cello as i was enjoying doing what i could but i could see that Daniel was not really itching to go back to the audience... and i did have another instrument...
Transportation,Jamey gave me one of the best gifts I've received from anyone ever this weekend quite by accident.
Transportation,In the absence of David Greene I do not expect to be meeting with Geri this Tuesday.
Transportation,If you're out of town take your mouthpiece.
Transportation,5-10 minutes per day every day.
Transportation,The king and I is finished I had an enjoyable time yesterday.
Transportation,I guess it depends upon how the individual that used the word defines/views it I am guessing that based upon your post that the implication was that this is a bad habit.
Transportation,In recent conversation someone (not one of our team) referred to my musical interests as a habit to be supported i.e.
Transportation,for some strange reason i am feeling the need to play a small Tuba :o) BTW planning to bring my bass to church for dulcimer play... as well as the horn and cello (celli) for afternoon play.
Transportation,Jamey I really appreciate the offer to fix my pipe.
Transportation,:o) Great to hear that Corey had a mini practice with a visitor how cool If you want i can try to help you solder up any holes and try to make the scrap metal less scrappy I have a small solder iron here and a large solder machine in Hagerstown.
Transportation,Hey Daniel thank you for the response to my musing epistle.
Transportation,Hey Corey it sounds like your trip was a success.
Transportation,I think that our individual practice efforts are paying off.
Transportation,As David and I are both practicing at Geri's home this evening let's plan to meet there with all brass players.
Transportation,Saturday afternoon is about the only time I can make it...At least for this week
Transportation,Wed or Friday could work for me.
Transportation,This sounds great Two more low strings.
Transportation,Remarkably I am back from my eventful and otherwise LONG trip.
Transportation,Speaking of fish when are we going to practice the Trout again I have two friends who would like to double up on the bass and the cello parts and play to have fun.
Transportation,Hello just a quick practice report.
Transportation,Yes but with big help from Vicki and Danny Thanks They look over my shoulder therefore next time more.
Transportation,Great plan it reminds me of a house that was being built next to a house i was helping to build... there was a dance floor being installed in the basement now home theaters are the norm but this idea is quite akin to that idea.
Transportation,This is an idea I've been mulling over for some time and it came back to me this morning.

Consulting,I remember feeling so hopeful after I pushed the 'send' button on the fax machine yesterday .... faxing 7 pages to a Recruitment agency...
Consulting,It has been quite a while since I have been seriously looking for a job.

RealEstate,So it's the infamous September 11th once again.
RealEstate,My feet hurt :'( sob sob I hate Wednesdays.
RealEstate,some old quiz results i just found.......... You represent... angst.
RealEstate,Just having a little fun on the internet...
RealEstate,I'd like to apologize to Jenny.
RealEstate,Today I made my first voyage back to lovely Mt.
RealEstate,Every once in a while there is an ad that really makes me wish I had thought of it first.
RealEstate,There really hasn't been much to say about my life lately because I have no life.
RealEstate,So I changed the color scheme.
RealEstate,I hate this shitty life and I want to die.... ...Oh yeah Happy Halloween Stupid Customer of the Day : too many to choose a winner Song Currently Stuck in My Head : nothing in particular
RealEstate,It felt so good to be away from home this weekend.
RealEstate,HAPPY MOLE DAY Anyway it's almost time for me to go to work.
RealEstate,If Veronica doesn't call me tonight I am calling Todd tomorrow morning so we can trade shifts.
RealEstate,I got a wonderful suprise when I picked up my paycheck.
RealEstate,Ok talk about an odd occurance.
RealEstate,I am so miserable right now.
RealEstate,Jeez can you believe it's October already And it fucking hailed and snowed today I feel so bleh.
RealEstate,I can't believe I slept in so late.
RealEstate,Listen you know who you are I am sorry you felt that way.
RealEstate,God this working two jobs is already wearing on me especially since I hate both jobs.
RealEstate,I am seriously so bored right now.
RealEstate,Yeah... so it's been a bittersweet last couple of days.
RealEstate,I feel my stomach wringling up into kinky knots.
RealEstate,Simply Ironic It's weird how the world works.
RealEstate,WOW It's been a while I haven't posted here in months... What can I say I'm living in California now.
RealEstate,Had a swell time with Dennis.
RealEstate,I miss my happy Jenny... Jenny really hasn't been herself lately.
RealEstate,And out of boredom came more quiz results... A Letter to Elise - You're in love but out of a relationship.
RealEstate,I feel so lonely... :( I need to go out get out get off my ass.
RealEstate,Ok I'll try not to be so much of a downer this time even though I still feel really depressed because I never get to go anywhere...
RealEstate,So the online catfight has begun... First of all yes I do remember what it was like when I was searching for a job but Jen is neglecting two very important facts: 1. she already has a job (which I never did at that time) so she at the very least has some form of income and 2. she is acting like this after about 2 +/- weeks of hard core job hunting.
RealEstate,It's just a boring Saturday morning/afternoon.
RealEstate,9:30 a.m.: So my boss went on a little vacation and left me with quite a bit of busy work.
RealEstate,I think things might be looking up but I hope I haven't spoken too soon.
RealEstate,I'm slightly disappointed in the fact that blogger cut off my interests.
RealEstate,GO PISTONS Seriously I am like the only person in L.A. rooting for the Pistons.
RealEstate,Yeah so yesterday was my birthday but it really wasn't anything special.

RealEstate,It's my birthday (not like ANYBODY cares) except for maybe Jenny
RealEstate,Well folks I have some good news and some bad news.... First the good news...
RealEstate,Things will be OK soon... right In any case I'll drink it all away.
RealEstate,And the earth shook beneath us...
RealEstate,I can feel the stomach acid wearing a hole in my tummy.
RealEstate,THIS IS TOTAL BULLSHIT Why can't I just get my fucking car back This is fucking ridiculous.
RealEstate,(Sorry Jen for being so mean in the last post.
RealEstate,I'm seriously beginning to regret my decision to move out here with Jenny.
RealEstate,If it weren't for the fact that the internet has been down at my apartment I would have been really worried because it's almost 2 and I hadn't heard from Jen until now.
RealEstate,1 to go 'til 100 not as if you really cared.
Consulting,Howdy to all- McFlurry Queen I love your insight.
Consulting,Welcome to the coaching world of weight loss....I hope to give some insight on my experience in the area (I have lost 100+) over the past eight months...and the changes (other then the obvious) that I have experienced.
Consulting,'If we listened to our intellect we'd never have a love affair.
Consulting,WOW what an awesome meeting last night...I commend all of you for your input and your willingness to open up to all.
Consulting,More and more research is showing that people who have the personal guidance of a mentor or coach have a far greater chance of succeeding on their weight loss program than those people who try and go it alone.
Automotive,One of those days yesterday....woke up sick...and dead tired from staying up on computer stuff all night.

Construction,Yet another conversation with yet another person (and no I am not talking to myself) had me thinking way into the night and keying my thoughts onto magnetised plates.
Construction,It is amazing the amount of blogs there are out there and the amount of topics that are covered.
Construction,While spell checking a previous blog entry blogger had the nerve to notify me that I had made a spelling mistake.
Construction,Much to my amazement I only realised last night that Thursday was going to be a holiday in Trinidad thus it will be another (consecutive) 4-day work week.

Construction,Quote from an email I received : (colors are as received) green white and gold the background of the email was white so the author decided to make the word 'white' black which in my own humble opinion spoilt the entire effect.
Construction,Solomon is a decent accounting software supported and further developed by Microsoft.
Construction,Microsoft should enhance the capabilities of the DOS environment and fully integrate it into the OS.
Construction,The other day I realised that I have the ability to morph into persons around me (not physically though) just in mannerism and to some extent speech.
Construction,Setting up your SQL Server to send emails using Outlook as the default client is all well and good.
Construction,Setting up SQL Server to send automatic email notifications was a nice little challenge for me.
Construction,My first report in Crystal involved calculating the Sum of Averages at different group levels.
Construction,Select IIF(field=0'positive' 'negative') as number from table Using SQL Server you have to use the CASE command SELECT number = CASE WHEN field = 0 THEN 'positive' ELSE 'negative' END from table

Construction,When you do without something for a while and one day you eventually get that something you are more likely to appreciate it.
Construction,I have a lot on my plate this week and nothing worthy of blogging has entered my thoughts.
Construction,So I have made my mind up.
Construction,HAVEWORLD has been given a makeover.
Construction,I create my first ASP pages this week.
Construction,...it really makes a big difference.
Construction,A caller to a morning TV program criticised parents for referring to their children as kids according to him a kid is a young goat and we should not be referring to our children as goats.
HumanResources,You asked me if I am okay How could I say I am nearly in decay I said yes I have always been feeling alright But I know that you can feel how I’m suffering inside I told you it is easy to cope with despair Just think that life isn’t always unfair Psyche yourself about happy moments That’s what I said you complimented me and you were impressed My dear you will never know how much I am aching for you You will never feel how my heart bleeds when you are with her But don’t worry I won’t falter I want to thank you instead for making me stronger I am not saying indeed that I cannot move on But as long as the two of you are together I will stay behind To support and listen to every word you say Just by doing so my sadness fades away Hey you are very special to me I don’t know what you did but I’m glad you’re in my life Our friendship is enough as of this moment I cannot ask for anything more I know that you care for me I feel the same way for you Always do take good care of yourself Someone over here is always praying for you Moonchild26/7/28/04/9:30pm

HumanResources,Tired of this pain which love has brought Expectations were unmet yet the heart still yearns for the beloved To spend even just a spare amount of time Surely the poignant wounds would heal the tears would subside Unprepared for what transpired one fine day Destiny’s surprise of introducing Unresolved however was the connection felt Was it true was it mutual….the answer is still point blank.
HumanResources,Why did it come to this point My love for you I have to conceal It hurts deep inside But I have to that is why It's hard for me to pretend as if nothing happened It aches everytime I think of that one single happy moment Yet we've drawn the line now here we are Arguing hurting each other for no reason at all Can't we stop all these and just have one last kiss If that is all we can have then it would be more than fine I still love you...
HumanResources,Here I go again same old feeling I wasn't in the mood for searching But you popped into my life just like that And now I cannot help my heart to stop From thinking of you dreaming of you You are so faraway from me what can I do Staring at the ceiling every evening Seeking for answers for this terrible yearning Who are you to let me feel this way Why do I want you to stay I am beginning to fall that I am sure But I guess I will never be emotionally secured You belong to someone else But who knows we can never tell If destiny will allow us to be together I wish it could be forever Let me love you in my mind Reality for awhile I want to leave behind For in my thoughts you are so real Your kiss your touch I can feel Allow me to say these words right now I love you I want to show it but I don't know how Please don't laugh nor ignore my feelings You envelope my world my total being cielo/7/24/04/4:38

RealEstate,As my description so eloquently states I have an opinion about everything...most people do.
HumanResources,The Center for American Progress noted the irony in Bush's appearance at the War College which has released a string of reports condemning the president's handling of Iraq and the war on terror.
HumanResources,The [President's] speech [on the course of Iraq] comes just a day after four-star General Anthony Zinni who was once in charge of all American troops in the Middle East appeared on 60 Minutes and scathingly criticized the administration's handling of Iraq.
HumanResources,The Associated Press has released a videotape that appears to back up Iraqi claims that the US bombed a wedding party last week killing about 40.
HumanResources,Michael Moore took home the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival this year.
HumanResources,More proof of abuse and this time it's fatal for (at least) five Iraqi detainees.
HumanResources,So no one really thinks that we will be able to get out of Iraq by June 30th.
HumanResources,I can't even begin to describe how scary the theology of our government has become.
HumanResources,After seeing the war in Iraq this soldier decided not to participate in a war for oil or to abuse prisoners at the command of his superiors.
HumanResources,There are lots of things that you can do to help take back our country from the big 'Dubya.'
HumanResources,First why is it important that you get your news from an alternative news source Many reasons.
HumanResources,TERRORISM – ADMINISTRATION MANIPULATED DATA: The LA Times reports 'The State Department is scrambling to revise its annual report on global terrorism to acknowledge that it understated the number of deadly attacks in 2003.'
HumanResources,Before a Federal Grand Jury people are starting to testify to the fact that President Bush knew about the scheduled leak of Valerie Plame's name to columnist Robert Novak.
HumanResources,Not that the Bush Administration needs satire to be funny (or tragic) but the folks at The Onion are really about as funny as it gets.
HumanResources,Dick Cheney is currently facing the potential of criminal indictments for his corrupt business practices before and during his tenure as VP.
Tourism,It’s another lonely night without you by my side.

Telecommunications,La ville de Quebec.. what a treat it was to experience it you again The rolling hills of Montmorency the tumultous Jacques Cartier the thunderous falls of St. Anne.. Quebec you have a place in my heart Who would have thought I would have had the guts to paint on a wetsuit and go shooting down 30 km of rapids with 7 strangers Delirious excitement replaced the debilitating anxiousness that seemed to devour me whole..
Telecommunications,“Help me I’m manic…” “Come with me.. You gotta see this “I can’t take all the stereotypes..
Telecommunications,would you believe the night i had I doubt it..
Telecommunications,A melancholic moonlight cast eerie shadows on your face as it pierced through the curtains.
Telecommunications,You don't know what words will remain once the restlessness in your chaotic mind has subsided.. You don't know of the emptiness that will devour your days when your desiccated soul is no longer nourished by my insatiable love.. As you struggle to find meaning in your belligerent existence you don't know the acerbity on your scorched lips is the venom that fuels your malevolent heart.

Haven't seen it yet It's in the titlebar... That's right that manic-looking creature not unlike myself right now Thanks for the call Jules... must be a bad case of temporal amnesia Disgruntled C.

Telecommunications,What a dreadful day... it's rainy and my joints ache really badly It's hard to imagine myself having a following but it seems that there are quite a number of you checking out my blog on a rather frequent basis.. thank you for your kind devotion Authorization from the portuguese consulate finally came down yesterday and as such my mom aunt and grandma will be flying to Lisbon this afternoon..
Telecommunications,I'll try to cheer up I promise... but yesterday's viewing was tough I sat in utter disbelief imagining his chest move up and down as if he were sleeping.. people I didn't know arrive in two's every half hour or so.. they sat in silence at first.. then got progressively louder as the evening went on..
Telecommunications,Just call me hack-a-lung.. but that's if i can hear you over my dry cough spells.. My hearing has been reduced to barely nothing which works out great because my ultimate pet-peeve is incessant bitching.. And at work it's highly abundant I still find it cool that my vocal range drops about an octave when I get a cold.. when I try to talk loud enough for people to hear my voice cracks and I sound just like my little pubescent cousin Diogo I wrote a blog entry earlier but it got lost somewhere in cyberspace and I can't remember what I wrote before... Goldfish syndrome - so sue me
Telecommunications,I can't believe this freak cold that showed up out of no where... if they didn't keep the office at a temperature that puts most meat freezers to shame I probably would be ok right now.. but here I am at work with my hooded shirt (thanks jules) looking like an ewok as Alan so kindly pointed out.. dripping profusely from the nose like a leaky faucet in a damp basement.. how's THAT for a visual I don't want your sympathy..
Telecommunications,I have started a new blog which is strictly devoted to mental health relationships and friendship issues..

Telecommunications,I like peaches… the non-fuzzy kind – are those the ones they call nectarines I like my peaches hard and cold… soggy fruit sucks My arm pits smell like peaches.. on account of the deodorant I have on not because I have special pores that emit fruity scents.. that would be awesome This entry isn’t about fruit… It’s about the fact that I feel nauseated by the scent of my fruity pits.. It’s because I haven’t been able to sleep properly in a week now and I’m too tired to focus on the road when I drive in to work… or because I sit in a daze when I’m at home while people talk to me.. my mom didn’t sleep well either.. she had a bad backache… she’s been restless of late working like a dog to distract her mind from the impending doom.. We’re all miserable these days… it’s hard to watch a loved one fade away as you stand by unable to do anything to help.. His body is frail brittle his breathing labored and intermittent… My heart aches at his sight I hope I can find the strength to keep being supportive and empathetic in a time when I feel I have nothing left to give nothing to spare..
Telecommunications,A more elaborate model that incorporated eight personal characteristics accurately sorted out 92 percent of the creative superstars from the less eminent.
Telecommunications,Some feel disgust at the sight of a defeated heart… others see beauty in the tenderness of a broken spirit.. Beauty I think to myself… I fail to see anything beautiful at the core of malevolent regrets heart-wrenching agony from impulse decisions failed attempts to pull oneself from the depths of an infernal limbo that plagues a tortured mind… Out of pain and struggle comes creativity I once heard.. A lot can be said for a tortured soul.. a wounded spirit.. images of flowers and surreal sceneries can’t come close to illustrating the strife some of us feel… Some write some paint some self-injure in hopes of temporary relief from a pain that never seems to subside.. Others fall prey to their emotions and end their suffering with one last impulse.. one last attempt to free themselves from their cross..
Telecommunications,they come swiftly and quickly without warning... Usually at the most inopportune times in your life when God knows you need rest.. Life is so finite when we are faced with someone elses mortality.. a frail body desperately clinging to existence with every laboured breath.. the heart aches in sight of such misery... their impending death resonating in our own bodies as a part of us slowly withers along with their fragile health..

Telecommunications,It's been a while now since i updated this page... My computer went to hell :( I can't find my copy of windows XP which i desperately need to fix my computer.. :( Everytime i log on to windows it logs me off right away... and so here I am feeling out of touch with the world... left with nothing to look forward other than to come into work where i can check my email and manage my bank accounts....

Architecture,I don't quite get the fascination or obsession that some people have about someone they really know very little about.
Architecture,Looking at some of my entries you'd probably think I'm generally a miserable negative person full of malaise and ennui.
Architecture,I need a freakin' vacation so badly now... Jesus.
Architecture,Shit why does my boss's ex always call up the office if he's never here and she knows his cell phone number For fuck sake leave me alone and don't bother me with that shit right now
Architecture,I feel like I need to cash in some of my sick hours and take the rest of the day off of work.
Architecture,karma coming into balance- aha there's the pain i remember i knew you would eventually show your ugly fucking face around here again sooner or later such is the universe
Architecture,how the hell am I supposed to keep my focus on this shit right now
Architecture,I've been having too many good things happen to me lately.
Architecture,When I was little I was very religious.
Architecture,What if you could choose the exact traits that the perfect member of the opposite sex (or the same sex if that's your thing) would have.
Architecture,Have you ever thought that you would put everything you thought made you happy on the line for a chance at what would make you really happy Do sticks and rocks matter ;)
Architecture,If my splice hasn't occurred yet I'm imagining that it will soon.
Architecture,My concept of time is warped right now.
Architecture,How did people communicate across oceans before there was copper wire and fiber optic cable How did people find long- lost friends without the internet It must have been agonizingly slow.
Architecture,I don't know why I can't leave well enough alone.
Architecture,I'm not entirely sure anyone is reading this blog at all so maybe I'm just talking to myself.
Architecture,Someone to go to my stupid movies with so I don't feel awkward sitting by myself in the theater (I have only done that once or twice in my life- as misanthropic as I may be I just cannot sit in a movie theater by myself).
Architecture,Aha seems that we are now able to alter the font size and color of our entries and the html Wow now I can put links on my entries like a real grownup.
Architecture,humming and humming I stare blankly at the damn refrigerator
Architecture,I feel like my mind is on too many things at once even though comparitively I've been a complete slacker lately.
Architecture,distracted always dirty thoughts run through my mind perverse yet loving
Maritime,A sick bag with 'bob' written on it turns out to be what made the pilot turn around yesterday fearing it may stand for 'bomb on board'.
Maritime,I can't stop thinking of you You're always on my mind These feelings deep inside me Some I cannot hide Your subtle words enchant me Lead me from the path Festering inside me I want you in my life If only things were simple The greys all shades of white Things moved down to simplicity I feel you in my heart The feeling feels of longing The longing longs for hope I hope that come one day I have to hope no more
Maritime,There is a starting point for conversation.
Maritime,I find the michael moore situation an interesting one.
Maritime,I want to go to france.
Maritime,Max Ehrmann Desiderata Go placidly amid the noise and haste and remember what peace there may be in silence.
Maritime,Why is life never that simple Why is life never life the nice margarine ads we all see on television Why It beats the shit out of me.
Maritime,The things i blogged ever so briefly about yesterday are all coming to pass.
Maritime,I'd like to say my life is like a roller coaster at times I suppose it can be... but on the whole it is more like a merry-go-round.
Maritime,“The feeling you get after bungie-jumping is going to be a lot better than the feeling you get after a chick gets raped” – Kurt “Hamish this could be important.
Maritime,Shutup I couldn't think of anything starting with a S :P As you might guess we had a qcs practice test today... 3 in a day.
Maritime,Klaire just linked me to this poem... its well... very sad.
Maritime,Another day closer to the end of the week Another day closer to QCS Another day closer to the end of the term Another day closer to the end of the year Another day closer to uni Another day closer to death (hopefully years and years away though) I finally finshed the spec poster and ticket.
Maritime,Ewww... continuing to do my english extension talk on what I am going to do as a thesis.
Maritime,Its funny that after 11 years of school that the last should go so fast.
Maritime,As you may see this page is now being hosted back with blogger agagin.
RealEstate,The earliest memories I have are foggy.
InvestmentBanking,one of my exes got a tattoo while i was dating him it was probably the stupidest one i've ever seen.
InvestmentBanking,we've decided there's something some part of us that still gets swoony at someone coming to our collective rescue with a sidle and an 'Excuse me is there a problem here'
InvestmentBanking,(to the crying child who didn't want his mommy to leave to join us at perkins) Lisa: 'Oh it's ok honey.. if you let us go i'll bring you back a giant muffin' Sarah: 'If i scream and cry next time you leave me will you promise me a giant muffin too' (when drunk mixing metaphores like i do) 'God that just drives the nuts outta me' (talking about how it's not fair some of the times she was mad at me in the past..) Lisa: 'Well i hide it it's not like anyone would know i'm after that guy.
InvestmentBanking,(should have guessed the truth from the title methinks.. ah well.
InvestmentBanking,Need/Deep/under my skin/in my bones/there is/an aching need/flaming desire/for one/one who/ignites my passions/effortlessly/with a touch of/his hand/my flesh is/aflame/consumed/leaving nothing/but the/skeletal frame/of my/needy bones/for him/to caress.
InvestmentBanking,remind me to show you.. and tell you why.
InvestmentBanking,what the hell is up with fashion lately lisa and i spent an hour going through a TERRIBLE sears catalogue yesterday.. the men's big and tall.. when did dressing like a woman turn cool some of these guys were wearing what appeared to be 2-piece moo-moos.
InvestmentBanking,Sarah: 'i know he'll like it - you know how cause he's like me only with a penis.'
InvestmentBanking,Joe: Sarah - thank you for loaning me $10.00 and i paid you back - in time to buy some tampons.
Architecture,Last night we went to the theater and saw a girl get her first boner.
Architecture,Sorry no posts yesterday - I was skiing.
Architecture,The Tall Grunge was really just a visual treatment not necessarily a final product for a front page or a template for the site.
Architecture,What are both of your ideas about what the front page should contain A stand alone graphic Some information I like the idea of a descriptive but highly artistic image on the first page.
Architecture,Here's another quick 35MPH treatment I quickly put together this evening in Photoshop.
Architecture,I completely understand what you mean Heath.
Architecture,OK - Troy I know that you were just playing around with Photoshop but...
Architecture,So I promised I'd post some Photoshop work I've done.
Architecture,Prior to the primary photography for 'Shadow Vision' I'll be setting up lights and recording equipment for a Tyson Foods Event.
Architecture,How about an update on your grip duties BWR
Architecture,Take a deep breath... we're about to go deep deep deep into the biggest 35MPH weblog post...
Architecture,A must-see site for those interested in animation.
Architecture,Coincidence As most of you know I work in a landscape architecture firm and rarely do my experiences in this field have anything to do with film.
Architecture,I don't know what 'streak knives' are but the Eldorado sounds like a honey
Architecture,This nice little site was forwarded on to me from Elizabeth's cousin in Hawaii.
Architecture,It's strange how these things come in waves... Just as the weblog gets started and ideas start flowing I get a call from Ozark Film and Video.
Architecture,A re-edit or (re-shoot) is definitely in order....but a trip to Austin for myself is not in the forseeable future.
Architecture,Long time listener first time caller...
Architecture,Over the next few days I'll start uploading some of our past productions.
Architecture,Okay I think we've cleaned things up a bit... and moved ourselves to the proper spot 35mph.com.
Architecture,It's really bright in here... and where's all the furniture
Architecture,Wahoo... now I'll never get any work done.
Architecture,It's a black and white neg that I reversed the values of.
Architecture,So is that image just a scan of the actual negative It looks pretty good.
Architecture,I've been playing with double exposures lately.
Architecture,Nice Bennett... keep the ball rolling and keep sticking your big fat wide-ass foot in all those doors.
Architecture,His GL2 That's like 1000 bucks...nice work.
Architecture,Just got a gig from a soccer Dad.
Architecture,Boy I wish I could read my own writing...
Architecture,I was unable to find the storyboards we made.
Architecture,I have some negs I can scan and post (with some help) from the Blackbird shoot(s).
Architecture,As for the font - it was some weird script we used.
Architecture,As I may have mentioned before my harddrive crashed while I was in NWA over Christmas.
Architecture,SLAVE1 has returned from the ashes.
Architecture,Thanks for the compliment on the image... to be honest it was only about an hour's worth of work and far from one of my favorites.
Architecture,Also I was wondering if Troy could put up the opening sequence from Blackbird up.
Architecture,I very much like the 'strange' image Troy made.
Architecture,Just a quick update on things...
Architecture,Just wondering if Troy could send a few screen shots from Untitled to Heath CJ and I. I'd like to take some of this content as well as original content and play with them.
Architecture,Do you have anyone in mind to play the parts Two main characters max
Architecture,Howdy all After several false starts I'm off and running on the 35mph blog More grabass from my blog which is grabass from life as a grad student.
Architecture,So you actually used scissors to cut up some prints Jonesing for some arts & crafts time Bennett Think you guys will want to volunteer in this Film Festival with me Take some time off and come up here
Architecture,Troy you've been an awefully busy guy lately.
Architecture,Sorry I haven't posted much lately.
Architecture,I shot three commercials on Monday.
Architecture,Well its been a while -- regardless I have some news that may be of interest to everyone.
Architecture,I just finished a neat little 'negative space' 35MPH logo.
Architecture,There shouldn't be any difference between expensive and cheap cards except maybe additional features and additional firewire ports.
Architecture,I just acquired a Firewire card.
Architecture,Firewire is definitely going to be the best way to go for video.
Architecture,I just installed some video editing software at home.
Architecture,Interesting Bennett... 'Do not try and bend the spoon.
Architecture,Here's a concept I came up with the other night.
Architecture,I haven't been able to read the second script.
Architecture,I haven't had the time or inspiration to work on the short I pitched you all earlier but I've got several first draft shorts written that might suffice for production without requiring driving shots.
Architecture,My trip to Arizona was a success.
Architecture,Some pics I've recovered from my harddrive.
Architecture,I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll get a nice graduation bonus from some family members come May.
Architecture,First: I may have access to the Canon GL-2 through the summer.
Architecture,how about this... we find a car - preferably one of those old boats that our parents / grandparents drove back in the day - that has a massive dashboard clearance from the windshield.
Architecture,After watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind again there might be a good way to incorporate the flashbacks into something like this.
Architecture,Hey there sorry I haven't posted in so long been real busy at work.
Architecture,but its worth a try since I can't use my phone to call until my free minutes start at 7 PM (my time mountain time); and if I wait 'till then I probably won't get a hold of you.
Architecture,I'll be in town June 7.
Architecture,How much music and sound do you guys think we'll use Do we have an acceptable way to record it perform it Do video cameras or cheap computer microphones record well enough to get away with I would be very interested in playing with sound effects if we have time to cram it in.
Architecture,So as a working title we'll call it the Labor Day Project.
Architecture,Ok so things shuffled around a bit on Thursday but here's finalized information for my new residence and phone.
Architecture,I recently encountered a long lost friend.
Architecture,I think I have found a story that is extremely adaptable...H.P.
Architecture,Ok so the first week of August is almost over.

RealEstate,Hi allSorry I haven't posted but have been off work 'sicky'.
RealEstate,Hi all Promised to post again tonight so I am but I have to be super quick as work is having a function thingy for one of the staff that are leaving.
RealEstate,OK so i am really peeved OK Last night I sat down at my desk and punched away at the keyboard for ages writing to all of you out there about my day (OK so noone has read this yet but you get my drift and I have faith that someone will come along who will take interest in my life).
RealEstate,Hi allWell I have been wanting to do something like this for quite some time somewhat like an online journal.
RealEstate,Hi allFirstly I would like to say how happy my Blogger makes me.
RealEstate,Hello all you imaginary folkToday my question for you all is whether or not I should travel and work overseas with my boyfriend while we are still young and free enough to do so And what does the whole process involve As I stated yesterday I am not doing terribly well in my new role which is very disheatrening to say the least I am feeling like an utter failure to put it to you straight but the thought has been with us for a while as to whether or not we are the travelling type My other half has his business up for sale and is unsure as to what he would like to do when it does sell and well you know my story... we are going to discuss the possibility of doing a work and play type thing travel and earn money perhaps London would be a goer for us before we come back from travelling so that we are able to fund the purchase of a house.
RealEstate,Well you know what they say people Yup all work and no play makes me a very boring individual indeedy I work in excess of 60 hours per week ok maybe i should rephrase that I attend my place of employment for in excess of 60 hours per week and because I am basically very crap at my job I am currently living off my payback retainer.

HumanResources,A few things... First I too was doubting Seans decision to buy an X-terra but offroading in the floodway was too much fun.
HumanResources,I may have doubted Sean's decision about buying an Xterra but the first night of cruising in the old floodway cleared me of all my doubts.
HumanResources,Just ask reynold about our little experience off-roading with the new xterra... pretty funny... let's just say that two feet of mud is a bit too much...

Architecture,Am I to take this seriously Let me get this straight...Bush is down in the polls against Kerry the numbers on the reported job growth are being crunched and it looks like the three million people who lost their jobs in the first three years will get new jobs to the tune of about $9000 less per year than the jobs that they lost There's still no sign of Osama and they expect me to believe that there is someone rambling around Columbus Ohio plotting to bomb a mall Who's linked to Al Quida I've been to Columbus and there is nothing spectacular about Columbus with the exception that Ohioans are amongst the last in our country to make up their minds about the course our country should plot for the next four years.
Architecture,Firstly I must admit that the leader of the empire had a good speach day last week in eulogizing Mr. Reagan but much like his reaction to 'The tragic events of September 11th'tm this was another slam dunk opportunity that was capitalized on.
