1,Info has been found (+/- 100 pages and 4.5 MB of .pdf files) Now i have to wait untill our team leader has processed it and learns html.
4,Thanks to Yahoo's Toolbar I can now 'capture' the URLs of popups...which means now I can show you some cool links to Korean Pop (K-Pop) audio and video without the need to relate instructions like: 'go to the site click on the pop-audio button then choose...'.
4,I had an interesting conversation with my Dad this morning.
4,Somehow Coca-Cola has a way of summing up things so well.
4,If anything Korea is a country of extremes.
4,I surf the English news sites a lot looking for tidbits on Korea and how foreigners (like me) view the 'Hermit Kingdom' but also as a way to keep up with this fast-moving place.
4,If you click on my profile you'll make a not-so-startling discovery...I was born in Year of the Pig as they say in the Korean/Chinese calendar.
4,Last night was pretty fun...mostly because of the company I kept.
4,There is so much that is different here from anything I've ever seen (well I haven't travelled that much just in Canada the US Philippines and Japan).
4,Here is the latest from the Korean rumor mill (it made it all the way to Coquitlam and my wife's ears).
4,So I've been in Vancouver a few days now...in Coquitlam actually.
4,Whenever I see a pregnant Korean lady I really feel for her because I know that within a few months she will have a 3-5 year sentence to complete and utter child-rearing duties.
4,My wife posed a strange question to me tonight.
4,As readers will know my favorite airline is Singapore Air (SAI).
4,When I was in Seoul these last few months I thought my wife had it kinda easy here with 'just' our 2 kids to take care of.
4,Korea especially Seoul is pretty cool; and Canada especially Vancouver is pretty cool too.
4,It seems everything is not all that smooth in Seoul concerning the recent changes.
4,Koreans have a great sense of community.
4,I used to cook for myself all the time (making bulggogi kalbi and even lasagna).
4,I often wondered where the restauranteurs heated up the briquettes or brinks or rocks that they placed in the table for traditional Korean cooking...then I saw this.
4,It feels like I didn't even leave this place which is a little scary.
4,It's been a busy last couple of weeks but I'm on my way back to Seoul today.
4,Some of you may remember my first article on oh-gyup-sal (five layers of fat pork).
4,A readers will know shopping in Seoul is a little different from back home (assuming back home is a Western country like Canada the US UK...).
4,In any developing country (and I believe Korea is 'developing' and really only started on the road to a real economy with the onset of real elections in 1994) there can be trials and tribulations for those who lead (politicians heads of business) and follow (workers students).
4,Just so you know this blog isn't about being political.
4,Korea is as you may have guessed a hyper-competitive place.
4,Ok you're probably looking at that title and wondering what the heck the connection is.
4,Yahoo Finally after being in Seoul for almost 2 years we closed our first deal.
4,I came across this in my daily readings of Korean news and sites...just trying to get a handle on this place.
4,Man how do I come across some of this stuff.
4,Ok it's not at all scientific.
4,Man with all that is going on I can see my posting to the ol' blog getting bogged down the next couple of week.
4,Ah finally...someone else I know is coming here from Canada for a visit.
4,Being gay in Korea is like being gay in the U.S. military...in 1950.
0,O= optimist P= pessimist My argument with myself: P: Nooooo Stop thinking about him O: Why He's my boyfriend.
0,I walk into the only entrance of my prison.
0,Why do I like him He's funny We have so much in common He is so cute We have the same sick mind He likes friends (I know huh) Unlike other guys he can actually match He is super sweet Never is he mad He is intelligent He is open almost... ok he's blunt He is witty He is NOT gay (see not all the good ones are) And yes ladys he is real... and taken.
0,I've fallen so deep so fast.
0,It's hard to think that we have less than a week together.
0,Stroke my face that's resting on your lap.
0,You may be wondering why my site is called 'Spaghetti Wall'.
0,I walk into a life long summer memory that I haven’t seen for two years.
0,I work at a day camp full of little kids.
0,What you are about to read is a “Quick Write”.
0,You think you’ve known yourself forever and will know yourself forever… until you change.
0,Have you ever felt so horrible: like a million knifes stabbing your body all at once.
0,“That’s not fair” I work with a ton of little kids so this statement is too well known.
0,Some people say “It’s not where you are going that matters it’s the journey on the way.” This may be true for some; however there are those who see it through my eyes.
0,Death can be a scary thing.
0,People are always saying “Just be yourself”.
0,Have you ever had the feeling you were alone Even though the whole world is surrounding you they aren’t really with you at all.

1,went to Jurong East for lunch today with limRoyTheoWilsonJerren.
1,Today we had bible study after school.
2,Well I hate to start off no such a sour note but things haven't been going so great with me lately and here's the dirty.
3,i have developed a pain in my chest that is quite worrying; whether it has arisen from an almost entirely carbohydrate-based diet or from over-stretching during an impromptu kata is unclear; the fact that it is making it harder to sleep is undeniable.
3,i have been given a book to read one that will 'change the way i think'.
3,(it is never good to start on a digression.
3,is getting up at five in the afternoon more acceptable if you went to bed at five in the morning i hope so.
3,we are drinking and talking of unrequited love.
3,in a moment of clarity i looked up the tablature for 'tightrope' by the stone roses.
3,an incident yesterday when a girl i was talking to on messenger clicked 'accept' for webcam feed before realising that she wasn't actually wearing a top.
3,whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre.
3,five in the afternoon is not a good time to be eating breakfast.
3,hiya i have some observations i'd like to share; like how sometimes it seems easier to go out of your way for people you don't know and how once you start ignoring the 'phone it becomes easier and easier not to ever pick it up.
3,i love the british railway system; who else would write to you to let you know they are going to write to you maybe i should write back: dear sir; thank you for your letter warning me of your impending letter; i was however startled to receive said advance letter without prior notice... i ask for the complaint forms with the tickets these days; it saves time.
3,oh and i meant to say everything's going to be alright.
3,quotes of the day: 'there should be more good stuff everywhere.'
3,let me introduce you to a place i've heard of; a place that does not exist.
3,there is a sign in the window of the local hairdressers that says 'models required'.
3,no toaster let nature do all the hard work a nice crispiness to bread can be achieved by simply placing the bread on a plate out in the open for several hours before consumption.
3,(more of these as i think of them) i) have a shower really late at night wash your hair.
3,you misread a product advertisment saying 'acid free' as 'free acid'.
3,of all the foodstuffs not recommended for the just-before-bedtime slot cheese with chilli sauce has probably got to feature somewhere near the top.
3,the loan adverts that are currently plaguing the television annoy me; i have begun to see the pattern they follow: i) having trouble paying bills ii) problems getting loans elsewhere iii) reduce your monthly payments iv) take your family on holiday or buy a new kitchen v) call now.
3,if lack of sleep leads to an involuntary lowering of defences then therapy this morning indirectly benefitted.
3,the humidity of recent days has lead to increased insomnia but has also lead to the first five minutes of returning home into a game of how fast the vast majority of my clothes can be removed.
3,a slow day; getting things done like cutting your toenails tend not to count as truly productive they are to the working day as shampoo is to the shopping list: something that occasionally has to be done but more of an imposition than anything else.
3,terrestrial british television is currently enjoying the simultaneous playing of great films: 2 has pulp fiction 3 has unbreakable and 4 has the shawshank redemption.
3,it seems that i am a difficult person to get hold of; or so i have been recently told by more than a couple of people.
3,night is the worst; its when i wander more when sounds seem louder and when i still find time to talk to her memory.
3,what an entertaining morning after the insights of therapy and the delight of having already had a shower (joy) i headed off to the shortest film festival in the world (...ever).
3,and no i'm not talking about the incessant rain.
3,i never figured on any of this; that much you should know.
3,the well-meaning drunk: oh sure their heart's in the right place and i'm glad he stopped by to apologise for all the noise and such but at half four in the morning there are better things i can think of doing.
3,quote of the day is good even out of context: 'there are things you don't do.
4,So many things I could talk about today.
4,when I was hanging out with Dino.
4,Ugh finally the only show worth watching on TV has come along.
4,We always hear statistics stating we are an aging nation but how does that really affect us All the advances in health care and medicine have people who might not have otherwise survived living till their 80's and 90's.
4,There are days it seems i have to much to say and no one to say it to.
4,that's what I would truly like to beeeeeee.
4,that's all i want to say to youuuuu.
4,so much and so much and so much...
4,I was thinkin back to a poem I wrote a while ago thought I had saved a copy...and now can't find it...I am going to try to get it back out of the deep recesses of my brain though.
4,Sometimes when you look for something so hard you don't see that what you need might be right in front of you.
4,what the hell is that dammit I just had a flu I don't want another I have to go back to work on Monday IIIICCCCKKKKKYYY I went there today to see what was up and found out they moved my desk or at least they will on Monday...so I will get to unpack all my stuff and set my junk up again lol.
5,I had this conversation with a man the other evening... more of an argument I suppose or at least a debate...
5,Have you ever read 'The picture of Dorian Gray' by Oscar Wilde It is an interesting book... here is an interesting bit I just came across reading today... (I'm rereading the book haven't read it in years) ~~'Only when one is young' she answered.
5,Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.
5,'Scars heal glory fades and all we're left with are the memories made pain hurts but only for a minute life is short so go on and live it.'
5,' Life isn't a journey to the grave with the intentions of arriving safely in a pretty & well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out & loudly proclaiming DAMN what a Ride'
5,First you should read my profile.
5,Ok. Maybe that last entry was typed with rose colored glasses on... he is a very great guy but I never get to see him that much.
5,It never ceases to amaze me how wonderful it is to go to Steven's farm ... out in the middle of nowhere with a half mile long driveway... it is quiet secluded... beautiful... not to mention that Steve is the most wonderful man on the planet...
5,I have the night off... And I'm spending the day and probably the night at Steven's...
5,I have had an on-again off-again relationship with Steven for the last three years.
5,Arwen If I were a character in The Lord of the Rings I would be Arwen Elf the daughter of Elrond.
5,Last night my night off I ended up working from midnight to 4:30 am because my best friend at work pulled a no-show no-call... he showed up at 4 seems he and his girlfriend were fighting all day and he took off too mad to think about coming to work... hmmm... he'd better grow out of that maybe take some anger management classes and maybe get rid of the girlfriend if she's gonna be that much trouble...just because two people have a child together doesn't mean they were meant to be together forever...
5,This place is wearing on me like it did growing up here.
5,Why can't I just learn to say no Last night at work a guy came in I hadn't seen in a while.
5,I have a habit of constantly heading down dead-end roads that I KNOW are dead ends.
3,Even though I am exhausted after today I must get in my rant to get a good night's sleep.
3,Today Travis and I went out to run a few errands and have a nibble afterwards.
3,Because I fear The Wraith and Hoggle equally as much it will probably be a while before a young fellow called Kristensen will hear about my joining the blogging world.
1,'PAinkiller' The past is like a gaping hole No matter how hard you try to run from it You just find that you are running in circles You think of the cause and effect Every action you have made The scar which the past had inflicted cannot be healed Like a wounded bird trapped in a cage You realize that the same mistakes being made Your conscience hunted you You start to doubt yourself Asking yourself the same questions over and over again You felt weak No longer the will to walk on Prayers to god was a momentarily salvation But never was it a cure Painkillers ease but not your pain As you see your love ones One by one Vanishing into the darkness When you tried to grasp and treasure them They were all gone Your eyes were hollow empty without life When you tried to love another Mistakes were repeated Sorrows and misery embedded Deepened and worsened
1,A cup filled with the rainbow of colours Each signify a different meaning Some surfaced to simplicity others hid deep meanings Colours varied in different forms When blue might appear blue Often it does not I was a boy A simple boy My appearance my shell My face my mask My heart is so disguise I fear so much to reveal my true self Will others shy from me Will the people who care for me leave Will I be alone So many questionsso many answers I need to know Fatigue washed over me like a tidal wave Maintaining the cloak sapped my strength The weight of the world weigh down upon me Nothing seems to aid Still I have to carry on Battling against an unseen enemy
1,Time past like a dragging cart I studied the sea of sweaty faces Some delighted in mirth Others solemn and distant While I struggled with my apparent task The weight of the rifle seems to drag me down Blood flowed from cuts Pain and fatigue weakened my determined mind I lick the dry skin of my lips My feet turn from flesh to lead My mind and eyes wandered As sun faded out of view The day ended The weight of responsibilities and rules lifted from my shoulders A young primary student walk past me Reminding me how fortunate they were But still they have to face the inevitable weight of responsibilities And the winding paths of failures
1,“We must not fail our duty let us ride on” Lysandros barked a command as he spurred his steed onwards.
1,The young elf ducked as a blade shimmered past at the same time lashing out and hamstringing his brutish foe.
1,Friends are like ships Anchored their lines by the harbor Each secrete their own goods Revealing only the hull Whether they bring wealth or disasters Cannot be foretold Some anchored for long others drift into the vast empty seas Some grow stale and become constant companions
1,I looked upon the world A pulsing light Growing every minute Daring and brave was I I challenge its unknown might Blood was spilled Tainted the lands A new champion arises Such was its might I was imprisoned Chained to the bounds of eternity Strength and life was drained from me The brightness in my eye flickered and faded Sorrows and agony clenched my heart Fatigue was my constant companion Memories and nightmares haunted me The aura of it presence tremble me every moment Flesh rot and hang from my whitish limbs The seductive allure of hell draws me towards it Writing the last sentence of my life I watched my life flashed before me Like a rat was I Staring at the unassailable titan Witnessing my blade turning to dust My armor my faith swept away with the currents My shield my honor is what I have left Crows and vultures flew the skies covering the sun to an eclipse Jokers and minstrels both sang and mock at my foolishness Perusing his poems And studying mine Looking down at my own demise Drowned my heart and soul
1,'Splinters Love' Dawn of the sun Is the end of night The end of summer Is the onlslaught of winter So many times When you love someone Even loving was painful When the love was broken So much does the splinters of love hurt the heart The birth of love Is the dawn of joy And the end of love Is the renewal of pain
1,'The puppet' His eyes sparkled A smile brightened his face He danced in the lucid night Twirling and spinning He sang songs equal of a bard Graceful was his movements and his soul and body became one Kings and queens were dazzled by his arts Servants and slaves paused in awe Time drags on And kings yawned Time and his mind became mine Strings attached Snapped and torned His purpose was fulfilled And so he was to end A smile faded his off his face
1,'The deer' Eyes darted Ears perked Shuffling sound of dead leaves Fingers of the frigid wind caressed the innocent soul Muscles and sinews tensed Watchful eyes watched its prey And wolves howl in triumphant Dark clouds shrouded the moon Shadows danced back and forth Signalling the end
1,There have been times in my life when I have felt helpless.It is perhaps the most acute pain a person can know founded in frustration andand ventless rage.The nick of sword upon a battling soldier's arm cannot compare to the anguish a prisoner feels at the crack of a whip.
1,'Five for fighting' Song I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find The better part of me I'm more than a bird I'm more than a plane I'm more than some pretty face beside a train And it's not easy to be me I wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie 'Bout a home I'll never see It may sound absurd But don't be naive Even heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed But won't you concede Even heroes have the right to dream And it's not easy to be me Up up and away away from me Well it's alright You can all sleep sound tonight I'm not crazy or anything I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive Men weren't meant to ride With clouds between their knees I'm only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street I'm only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me inside of me Inside of me yeah inside of me inside of me I'm only a man in a funny red sheet I'm only a man looking for a dream I'm only a man in a funny red sheet And it's not easy… It's not easy to be me
1,'The hierachical order' Blades tore skies apart Lightning splits the wounded bird Silent winds swept the lands asunder Angry clouds darkened the skies Scythe of reapers plough the cities Lucid dreams haunted in forms of echoing shadows Treachery spoke louder than compassion Every corner was a silent dagger And a coup practiced neater than a courteous bow Even masters contorted in fear While slaves waited for the darkness to descend Shadows rise and fall unendingly
1,Unsurprisingly it is the 14 of june.
1,'Knowledge' Pages withered wise and old Pages flipped dust fluttered high and low Worn and tattered hid its view from common man Centuries flickered in the light of words The wise wrote its course And the lesser ones seek its enchantment
1,'Truth of reality' As I sat on the sun set hill How the scenery seems mundane compared to you Looking into your enchanting eyes The presence of you gladdens my heart And your words sweeten my soul Time stopped parallel to space Holding your warm hands seeped the strands of love You are the one Who I’m willing to sacrifice for upon the altar of love To brave through the flames of hell To don the shinning armor and be your knight To hear your sorrows and despairs To understand and love you But when the dawn of reality shines upon me How I realize This was all an elusive dream There is no everlasting love No true love Every lie renders me apart Leaving me torn and tattered in an inevitable demise Dark devils fed my soul And men mocked my foolishness Winter now prey upon the land Leaving it bare and dead Life faded into the whispering wind
1,'Power of love' They say angels birth from hell And devils warp from heaven No one knew the truth When time fled into space And space into time None shelter it with concern When love seeks to blind the heart of the lonely one None forsee its path As the blinding of love unbind it self The legends of knights in shinning armor reincarnated The soul of saints rebirth And the blessing of the gods shone once again Such awe and splendour Hidden in the seed of love itself
1,'Flashes of life' The winds blew the memories of the dead The past flashes like a train Emotions swelled to pain sadness and joy Familiar faces carved into the graves Something emerged triumphant The icy cold swept up in a torrent devouring the warm and lush air Like a man frozen with no feelings thoughts nor love
1,They say there is nothing we cannot overcome in life What of times when steel of determination were cut open by the blade of love Fallen so many times to dark pits Hurt torn and shattered.
1,It was her face which etched clearly in my mind
1,Love present past and the future Where art thou I left my dreams and hopes As the light shimmer of memories To a new land I am there Smashing the mirror I knew there was no way back Ruins of past and present lay before me Am i to find the one who i love and who love me not in the midst of the sunless lands Where the wind seems an absent vacuum And the air tainted with death My home I do not know There seems not a presence of a smoke nor shadow AS i tread lifeless waste I found a charcoal sheet Upon it wrote ' July 2 Year 3210 '
1,Love never dies a natural death.
1,There were so many times When i look into her eyes but yet she shun them from me So many times Is there an end I knew i must leave But where Perhaps somewhere where I can find love and care or perhaps a dark corner where i can cry alone I do not know..
1,Fatigue reverberate though the ear Deep lines of wrinkles carved in depth Dark lines embedded by the eyes Pensive thoughts swam in the hollow pool Influx of memories flooded like streams of river Yet tainted and impure it was Strands of white brushed softly against the wind And eyes faded to dark thoughts Where death stalks in the shadow Wisdom and knowledge dwindled into the vast ocean
1,Standing by the window Watching the bright stars shine their light Seeing her face in my mind Listening to the song of the nightingale Feeling the soft caress of the wind Dwelling in solitude -- Pieces of puzzle Fixed on piece by piece I knew so many answers Yet I fear to face them -- Call me a liar a fool But I hear not of them If there was a chance to spin the wheels of time To reach the tunnel of past and present To staunch wound which bleed in my heart -- I would still say
1,When I saw everything cumbling before me
3,I'm at work eating lunch right now.
3,WellI just got out of my last class of the semester.
3,I can't believe that no one has commented on my Zelda post.
3,Yesterday I was driving somewhere and Mongolia crossed my mind.
3,I've just checked out the page for the new Zelda game and I have to say that I can't wait for it to come out.
3,Read this and rejoice (unless you live in South Carolina) That's right folks coming soon to a South Carolina near you Christian Fundamentalism They plan to break away from the nation to form an independant christian country lets all pray that they get it.

3,Woohoo - she'll be here tomorrow - which probably means I need to clean the place up a bit - uh oh :( Since Jen's going to get a car we'll be able to at least grab some furniture so she'll have somewhere to sit - and she has timed it perfectly for the pool opening on the weekend.
3,That's right this is the week Jen arrives on Thursday and will be staying right through to the following Sunday - Yay :) Also on the good news front I now have Cable TV Broadband and a new mattress.
3,I'll be getting bot a new mattress and cable TV/Cable internet on Saturday.
3,My stuff from Ireland arrived this morning - so I now have all my CD's DVD's clothes etc.
3,I've decided to document my little adventure in America.
3,Not so much from the what happened point of view as from the 'thank God it's over' point of view.
3,Well now that things are settling down a bit I find I have a bit of spare time on my hands.
3,Woohoo - I got my learners permit This time I got every question right though if I'd had this test last time I would have had no trouble then either - just the luck of the draw I guess..... Now all I have to do is learn how to drive before my car arrives next month :) Yesterday was a pretty good day all round in fact - as well as the successful test the Pistons destroyed the Lakers.
3,Just realised I never mentioned the new chair - My Lazboy arrived on Saturday and I'm glad tosay it rocks :) On the bad side of things - I managed to fail the theory test on the Virginia drivers license exam so I have to re-take it tomorrow........grrrr What's annoying is that I needed 20 correct out of 25 and I got 19 - the last question was how much more likely you are to have an accident if you are drunk - 5 times 7 times 10 times or 12 times.
3,Finally got around to installing linux (fedora core2) on the laptop - it is working quite well I even have wireless networking going on it using the Netgear WG511 card I bought a while back - Nice :) Also have the bare bones for 2 new systems - one dual PIII 1Ghz and one dual PIII 866.
3,Jen left last night and it was 10 times worse than when we said goodbye back in the Old Country - at least then I had all the excitement of going to a new job a new country a new apartment etc.
3,My apartment now looks like someone actually lives there my DVD's CD's and books are up off the floor though not arranged in any meaningful order yet ;) As soon as the desk arrives (should be tomorrow) I'll post some decent pictures of the whole thing.
3,Unfortunately it sems that my webhosting company has gone tits up.
3,OK I knew that the whole Atkins diet low carb thing was big in the US but I was still surprised when I got here at how pervasive the whole thing is.
3,Decided it was time to flex my coding muscles this week so I've put together a little tool that converts IP Addresses URL's and Host names into Autonomous System numbers and gives a few other little tidbits while it's at it too.
3,Went to see Spiderman 2 last night - have to say that I liked it - didn't have the fun of the first one when you were learning how they were going to implement all the superpowers and stuff but still good none the less.
3,The site has been down/slow for the last couple of day - no idea why and I'm too lazy to find out.
3,I got a letter yesterday from Audi Financial saying my credit application had been turned down.
3,Picked up the new car yesterday - I still can't drive it without a licensed driver in the car too but that should all be rectified soon enough.

3,Negative energy don't we all have some of this within I would think we would have to considering all of it that surrounds us.
3,I would like to start out with a little explanation as to who I am and why I have created this little corner of my world.
1,One of my favorite topics..Its there cuz I had always been intrigued with it...And the intrigue ceased when I decided to try it out..But it wasn't for fun...I just felt bad....Felt alone...Desperate..
1,Death-..Once again on my mind that simple desire for something that only time can bring...Or maybe that accident I've always dreamed of...To die doing something I love...Or just walking down the street...Alone...As always...Just to die now...Alone...All alone leaving nothing behind..No one to cry for my death..My disappearance...For the way I just left for my own will...I had gone because I wanted to...I really do..I wish it would be as easy as it seems...I mean..Its just dying..I actually don't care where I'll go after death..It doesn't matter where my destiny shall take me when I'm gone..As long as I was gone....As for what I believe...Anything is better than being alive and having to be right here...Right now....As if there was anything left for me in this world...Anything worth my time..Anything worth living...Anything worth that so called 'limited time' God.. (as if he was real jajaja) gives people is just shit...At least for me it is...If anyone could ever want it..Hey its yours...Its not like I'm gonna use it in anything better...I feel as if I didn't need it...As if there was no use in having to live...Living was just meaningless...I was..And am gonna die anyways...So why not just do it now.....Why live anything more.Some say life toughens you by experience...Bad experience...But I don't want to get any tougher...No more experiences...No more suffering....No more life...Please I beg you...Take this away from me....Take my life where I cant ever find it again..Take it somewhere else...Hide it....Disappear it....Make it fade away...Put it in a box...Lock it away...Lock everything I once had away...Feelings..Memories...Thoughts....Wishes...Dreams...Take it all away...I don't want it in me anymore...I just want emptiness...I want to feel nothing..At all...Just to be empty inside...So that I don't have to go through anything that could harm me...Ever again...Just to be hole...Empty.....Useless....
1,“There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is only the comparison of one state with another.
1,There she was..Standing there in the middle of the night..All tied up inside because of her problems...No where to go...No one to save her from what she was becoming....Losing her self in the atmosphere...Loosing her self in no ones dreams...Loosing her self in between....Lost...Trying to find her way...Getting nowhere...Trying to find a place...A spot to stop hiding...Start facing what was going on in her life...To start realizing NOTHING was alright...And it was never going to be...Not ever....Never again..To realize..That she had lost it all...
1,'I walk down the face of this Earth alone.
1,There I stood..In that dark cold night...Staring right into those eyes who had been watching me as I walked through that dark...Endless forest....Those eyes that had watched me...That had followed me..All the way through the forest....Then I got lost...That's the only reason I saw the eyes on the first place..I felt watched ever since I entered the forest....But I didn't want to look back...So I just went on...But now...I was lost...I got lost and looked all around...But I stopped in the eyes...Dark eyes...I could only see some little shine on the...But no color...Just shine..And I was freaked...I looked into those eyes..But wasn't scared at all...Those eyes seemed to be admiring me...Meant no harm...But as I looked at them they drank my essence..I didn't feel anything..I just felt tired...But I wasn't tired...I was just dying...Slowly...Maybe too slow to notice what was happening...To really know that I wasn't ok..That my life...My essence was taken away from me...Because I got lost and looked into those eyes...Then I died...After hours of staring...I died...Those eyes took all my Essence...They took my soul...They took all that made me...Well...Me...
1,I said I had enough...Of you...Of the world..Of everything..Of existence...Of life...It's senseless to be fed up and still have to be..Please something kill me....Now...
1,Never thought I would end up here...Where I was...Lost stranded...But happy....It's that kind of happiness that simply exists and is there for no apparent reason...That happiness that becomes confusing after a while...It's great being happy....But that day it was stranger than ever before..I was happy...Yeah great but then again it had no explanation.-...And I wasn't just happy like any other time that happened...I felt stupid....I laughed at everything and it all seemed great....What the hell was happening to me....I mean not only the happiness...That almost never happened...WHY...I mean not only that there was no reason...But that even though I was happy it didn't feel good...But the day went on...As for my conscious side..It went to sleep.....Then I woke up on this room with cushioned walls....What the hell had happened last night....Why was I in a mental hospital....What did I have a straightjacket on...What had I done...What the hell was wrong with me... Then the doctor came in...He told me I had been killing people...But that I wasn't just killing them...He said I danced with them...Told them how happy They should feel to finally understand the meaning of life....That they should be as happy as me...Then I understood...All those days I had felt happy I had woken up in a police station acussed of inappropriate behavior towards other people..I was hurting them...Trying to take their lives away...But I couldn't...Until today...The day I realized that happiness just wasn't meant for me..It wasn't meant to be..I'd prefer being condemned to a life in depression than a minute of happiness in which I ended up killing people...Taking their lives was what made me happy...Keeping them...Even more...But being stuck in that white cushioned room took all the happiness away cuz when insane...It's better to just do what your mind tells you...cuz if u don't...Things get worse...
1,Reach out..Find air...That's all that went through mi mind at the time...I felt tired...Had no air....Needed some air...To breathe...To live on to continue with this torturing existence...To live on in this pathetic side of the world...The only reason I had was you...And you in my mind always..I had to get over the place I was forced to live in...I had to become someone...Be something to get to you...To reach you....To finally get to be with you....To know myself...Cuz I find myself in you...
1,I never thought that I wouldn't hurt...I really thought it would...For life....But it just didn't....I thought the pain I was about to feel would change what I was..For ever...But it didn't....The pain of the knife the pain of death the pain of suicide...None of that's real...There's no pain at all...Watch as my life fades away from me....Watch me as I stand there...Bleeding....Bleeding like I never had before...The life that I had once had was fading away...Leaving my side...And it was through the blood....That life went away....From me...
1,Alone..Living by myself living in a world made for those 'sociable' ....Those considered normal...Common....But not for me....I turned out wrong...I went the wrong way around...I'm not a good part of society....Cuz I don't feel like part of any kind of society..Only my own...Not because I'm a bad person or anything like that....What happens is I'm not the same as everyone else...I've got my issues..My stuff..My things that make me feel good..But that seem weird for the rest of the people..I'm in my own little world....Living by myself..But still I'm happy....Cuz I don't have to be like everybody else to be happy..I just have to be me...
1,Time stood still as I tried to trace my way in the fog..I've never been so lost..I've been trying to find my way for so long..But now I guess where I am is where I'm supposed to be..This must be home..I was home all along..But home doesn't feel good..It feels..Well...Kinda lost actually..I'm stuck in this war between what I am..And what I want to be..And what I want to be just doesn't make me feel better..So it's awkward..But its where I am and what I am..So that's just it..Good or bad....Who cares its just me..
1,..There I Stood In Front Of My Fears..Facing Them..Trying To Overcome Them..But It Was Just To Much To Take..The Lights Faded Away..And So Did I..
1,actually I'm not entirely dead..Well my body is alive..But I'm not...My soul died..Very long ago...Ever since...Well it's too long to remember..I believe people see me alive 'cuz its like a burden a have to go trough..Day in day out of having to be in this fuked up place..Having to exist...It sucks ass..Who cares if my language is inappropriate ..You'd say the same if you had to live here...Believe me you would...There's nothing nice...Nothing good about it...To have to go through this...Everyday...I wish I could die entirely..But I cant..I just exist because I have to..There's nothing more to it..And I wish there was just nothing..At all...No existence no living...Not having to be..
1,...No sense in living..Life has no meaning..But death can't be controlled by the human hand..So..
1,I'm cold..Freezing..Lost..Fading away..Feeling alone..Left out..Desperate..It feels bad..But not bad enough to look for you...I'd rather live a life alone than spend 10 minutes with you..I'd rather talk to myself..Invent people...Have imaginary friends..Anything is better than you..I hate you..I wish you had never existed..Never had come into my life to ruin it..I wish I had never been your FRIEND..cuz I was a true one..You were just like any other hypocrite..Trying to get things out from me trying to know my secrets to then make them public..Betray me like any other bitch..But who cares....I'm better off without you..And I'm glad to realize what you are..I hate you..Very very much..Please die..You should..Just keep it in mind.. 'later..
1,Life..Death..//..Somewhere in between..that place where you see those you loved in life..but don't seem to be able to get close to them...to have any kind of contact..you see them...you feel them..but they don't..they believe you're dead..and you are..but it doesn't feel like death...you don't even know how death actually feels like because you had things in the world of the living that you didn't do..that's why you're there...stuck in the middle..no sense in trying to go back...cuz there's no way back...
1,Looking 4 a place...searching 4 a soul....to be just like mine...to like the same things I do...looking 4 you...to come and save me...to take me away from where I now am..to save my soul from me...from what I've become..from THIS....what I am....to take me away from where there's no way back..from where I cant escape..but now...I can't seem to find you..you're not here..and I can't search no more...I'm tired...exhausted of trying to find the one that will never come..now I realize I'm alone...left in pain..left in sorrow..left somewhere in between what is usually called Good and Evil ...left in a place where I have to decide where I wish to go..but I don't even know what I want....what I wish for..where to go...left or right..'good or bad'...I cant decide...but being where I am isn't better..and I cant decide..
1,So..then again why am I ten feet under..
1,Death..My perfect state...That simple point where reality is a dream...A nightmare once lived...A simple memory that comes back to torment our soul...A place where no one wants to go back to...A point where everything seems worse that it is..Everything makes sense and it all sucks...You stand in a point in which everything you do has a consequence...Everything takes you somewhere else..Somewhere worse than before...All of this shit that doesn't exist when Dead...Death is a rest...A simple lay back...Plain relaxation....A stage in which there is nothing..At all....An empty play..No actors..No actresses...Not even a back stage crew...Simple emptiness...No feelings...No dreams...No memories...No LIFE...
1,Everything's lost...Everything fades.....You have nothing...And you wish to go back....But hey....There's no way back.. ¬|WELCOME|¬ ...you've reached the point of no return....You and you mistakes are here..Nothing good lies in between these walls...Everything that once tormented you is here....Just to make your life miserable...Here in the point of no return you live as if life was a simple burden...Nothing is good...And for some nothing's changed...Life is a burden...And it will ALWAYS be...If you don't stop running.......So STOP....Face everything you've done...Every mistake you've made..All of those things you've tried you run away from will haunt you if you don't stop running and start facing....Life isn't milk and cookies...And it'll never be..So it all depends on what you do..To continue running or start being YOU...
1,My mind got lost.......Last thing I remember...I was stuck in a hospital.....I think someone stabbed me....cuz there was a lot of blood...I woke up on a bed...I had been unconscious for quite long...According to what the nurse said....Still I can remember some parts of the surgery....All that blood...All my blood there..On the floor..On the perfect white sheets....On my friends' shirts...On the doctors cloak...There was blood everywhere.....That delicious dead-like smell....Blood mixed with some alcohol......Everyone's so nervous....All the doctors saying were loosing her.....Fuck she's leaving....All the nurses giving things to the doctor...Helping him....All of them saying....Pressure level is too low.....We need more blood....And some other injections....I cant remember very well....Then..Everything was black again..I fell unconscious.....Miraculously I woke up....I saw the nurse.....Asked her for a piece of paper...And some water.....She said I couldn't have either of them.....I tried to ask why...But the words didn't come out.....Everything turned black again...And light never came into my eyes again.....I was dead...

2,I much prefer that opening to Lucas's 'A long time ago in a galaxy far far away' but I have to admit that one of my favorite parts of a very funny speech a friend of mine used to give revolves around the fact that although Star Wars is futuristic it's supposed to have happened in the past.

5,In an earlier post Johnathan said: 'And then: What of Gregory Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun patrolling the darkness that lurks therein ........
5,I'd post this on the RTG Blog but I can't post there.
5,The answer to the first question lies with Master Po; the answer to the second is Sister Jayna the priestess who took over after Castillion departed.
5,it seems odd to think of brother ian as having a father.
5,since our next game is the weekend of halloween why don't we all dress up like our characters next session
5,- Hillsfar ruled by Lord Malthiir believed by the party to be a former gang/crime lord who came to power by unknown means.
5,perhaps we can have it that if an email is sent out that a confirmation email can be sent back.
5,Mir -- Ben said something about 50/50.
5,I don't know how long RTG will last.
5,and as far as characters go i like luc - i want to see where her story goes - i've committed over 2 years to seeing how she would develop and i want to see the ending.
5,and i don't even believe that duellacathata is actually dead.
5,To be fair Duellacathata didn't directly frame the party; that was (supposedly) the desire of K'Sh'Aal (or rather his/her/its representative).
5,i'm going to stick with Ian for now.
5,Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian) the group will be at an interesting crux: What Next The party is now international in membership and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.
5,Referring to Johnathan's post I think that the party clearly does not have the same goals.

5,Perhaps you can make notes to yourself during the game as John did.
5,very interesting but hard to keep in head all at once.
5,Hey folks -- check your email No game today.
5,i will be there for the entire game this week.
5,Even funnier if you replace the guys with a drow a beholder and an illithid.
5,joke moved to circle of irony err...actually not.

5,...but the spirit of the fellowship remains so long as we hold true to the purpose of the one we sought and found.
5,Having acquired the proof needed to clear themselves of the murder charge the party accepted an offer from the shadowy K'Sh'Aal to eliminate the would-be crimelord who framed the party.
5,yeah i don't know why people don't go to this site -
5,Even the crickets have stopped chirping....
5,yuggoth - fungi demon lord starting to invade higher reaches of underdark.
5,in case anyone wishes to know i did get accepted into the english grad program.
5,in response to ben's journal entry - even though what we are doing may have no real significance and no will ever know the actions we will perform this day it is still important that we do them.
5,this article discusses the american support of and the merits of torture used on political detainees.
5,The poet is in command of his fantasy while it is exactly the mark of the neurotic that he is possessed by his fantasy.
5,it's odd and sad - mary magdalene is here but where are peter and judas
5,nobody reads this damn thing anyway so i'll attempt to be poetic (and also because johnathan challenged me once long ago about knowing the meaning of love).

5,welcome mark no as ms. tree has already addressed i am not in NYC.
5,you guys have got to love this article - he not only says lucas has no talent that star wars is a bunch of rubbish but also that joseph campbell just sounds erudite but is really a gas bag.
5,i'm going to move in with you tree.
5,No Mark Tree lives in NYC.
5,Ben does this mean that you're now living in New York I never seem to hear about anything that happens on the east coast anymore.

5,you've come a long way baby 'Before all of this happened I was extremely interested in posing' Silvas said in an interview posted on the Playboy Web site.
5,Speaking of Russia what in the world is going on here Russia became a junior member of NATO recently (like 2 days ago).
5,in response to the russian article - every religion has it's beginnings somewhere and who knows we can be looking at the beginning of another christ cult.
5,I am going off of other people's words here but supposedly the Ep II novel discusses spirits (for lack of a better word).
5,'Sergei Torop was a traffic cop in the small Russian town of Minusinsk until 1989 when he announced that he was the son of God.
5,i think you may be putting much more thought into your analysis of the movie than was actually put into the script for attack of the clones or phantom menace.
5,something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: 'disappearing' vs. 'leaving a corpse' at the death of a jedi.
5,the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members: shannon erwin and johnathan 'better-late-than-never' shipley.
5,allright shannon who is edward jones does he have a good job is he nice to pets and children you haven't seen episodeII are you sick
5,I have not seen Episode II yet so cannot actively participate in the current thread but I just wanted to let everyone know that I am present and accounted for and thanks to Ben for inviting me back into the sandbox.
5,the whole thing was a dupe engineered by palpatine/sideous to take control of the republic with a now tried-and-true army to back up said control.
5,Too many unanswered questions that I don't think will be answered in Episode III: 1) Who was Jango working for On one side he was the basis for the clones.
5,so what did everyone think of the starwars movie
5,check out ben's picture on the sbac site (i believe it is called art damnit under the links - he's in the tobacco gallery section - probably only up for a few more days and he has hair
5,an argument for absolutes in what seems to be a subjective universe - in order for certain mechanisms to work they must have an order - there is a specific way it must be done or it will not work.
5,well folks you won't get any commentary from me for the next few days - i'm going on a trip - on a plane.
5,i love that smile you can enter the secret city (if ben has not already told you over his cube wall) is to go to the main site - and there are listings of other places you can go - links - the last link is a link to the secret city which i assume is a type of journal.
5,This sercet city is indeed a secret to me.
5,Um...testing...testing.... ....is this thing on Hello World Ben I can post :-D
5,group: make sure that when you refer or respond to information from a source outside of this blog that you include enough information for everyone to understand and appreciate the source; i know the traffic here is pretty low but please only post complete thoughts or responses to thoughts on this blog.
5,watch that pendulum swing baby some of my favorite quotes: 'This is new.
5,one final note (for now) on the marriage as solution issue (and yes i think salon is presenting an extreme view - shock) from what i have experienced in life (which is limited indeed) one of the best feelings one can experience is to see a person touch them and realize that no matter where you physically are that you are home.
5,i also read the article about marriage and while i believe it is valid that we need to create and maintain relationships outside of our primary romantic one there must be a reason why this desire for long-term bonding has consistently been a part of societal structures.
5,if you would like to have a better understanding of how i view life and the world- and god knows i know you do - i would recommend that you read 'notes from underground' by fyodor dostoevsky.
5,maybe someone in this circle who has a scientific background can explain to me why toxic sludge is good for fish.

5,oh come on john - how old are you 33 by the way everyone have you seen johnathan's play if not you are a bad friend and should whip yourself ..... or you can go see his play not to ruin anything but he doesn't really break the stick.
5,32 huh Youngster ;) Why don't I support Kyoto A) I still not accept that there is global warming.
5,that is odd that the EPA would send out positions that are not supported by the whitehouse.
5,i suppose the question is then john at what price security unlike you i have never really had a well paying secure position.
5,Mir - I have no idea how old you are but I think we are all seeing the effects of disatisfaction with our current lots in life.
5,Aparently and I have no text to back this up the report sent to the UN came from the EPA and not the White House - small but significant difference.
5,it's amazing how many diversions and distractions we create for ourselves.
5,john don't get my hopes up like that.
5,I agree Mir the man should not be tried.

5,Having grown up in Mississippi I can say with some certainty that I agree with my future husband about his assessment of Lott.
5,chris i compared strom thurmond to adolf hitler not trent lott.
5,It seems to me that neither Republicans nor Democrats ever really discuss what I would call politics.
5,Oh Mir -- it's nice to see that things haven't changed As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler.

5,Baby I remember all the things you taught me...
5,ben is signing the papers for his house tonight - congratulations ben
5,I must take issue with such a sweeping statement -- I for one am not 'culturally set up' to do this.
5,quote from allan gurganus: We're all culturally set up to look for that one other beloved object who will complete us and satisfy us and sate us and make us look good.
5,I now have True Blue going through my head.
5,Uma Therman can't hold a candle to Bea Arthur with a strap-on
5,ben had just made out with ethan hawke and i was getting ready to watch uma thurman strip to 'underneath it all' when the damn phone rang.
5,Personally I have nothing against predictable movies.
5,chris i actually saw the film mbfgw - and this was before it became 'popular.'
5,you are already my soul sister angie.
5,1989 - 'Epic' 1991 - 'Losing My Religion' 1994 - 'Black Hole Sun' 2002 - 'Lose Yourself' My goodness but that 8-year lag was too long.
5,'Toe pick' I like the Cutting Edge too.
5,I never thought boys were gross.
5,Some random popcorn movies I consider equal to the Greats: Die Hard Raiders of the Lost Ark Star Wars Jaws Goldfinger The Matrix (with reservations) Terminator 2 (the first I consider only borderline popcorn like Alien or Blade Runner) Aliens True Lies Dirty Harry Ghostbusters Animal House Back to the Future Beverly Hills Cop Wargames Trek II Lethal Weapon.
5,I have not seen the movie and really had no intention to but Julie wants to rent it on DVD so we will rent it at some point.
5,All right now Keeng I never said that I hated MBFGW.
5,You're right -- success does affect my opinion.
5,I sort of boycotted the film mainly because I don't like 'look it's funny 'cause their culture is different from our culture' movies.
5,It would be nice if from an emissions standpoint the SUV was classified as a truck instead of a car.
5,And with the crack of ice breaking on concrete all her plans and all her schemes collapsed in a single cascade of glittering regret -- only to tumble and pour and pile into an awesome tower of sparkling rage brilliant and hard and cold under the pitiless winter sun.
5,You're gonna see your sheba shimmy shake.
5,I have never seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- I just chose to hate it as an act of personal freedom.
5,I'm sure that's nice for some people but I've about had my fill in life of only realizing something's worth by losing it.
5,sometimes the best way to be reminded of something is by its absence.
5,oh my god i hated my big fat greek wedding too johnathan and i are soul sisters
5,In retrospect I was pretty much describing the average American in that last post so to include SUVs was irrelevant.
5,I just think they look cool.
5,SUVs....for myself if I had kids I'd prefer the Honda Odyssey.
5,john i'm sorry you're so upset about the loss of the holy ghost.
5,so true: After several gentle conversations I have finally gotten my fianc to share his fantasy with me: He wants to have sex on the top of a bunk bed.

5,i think we can all agree that angie is a wonderful human being and that we all wish her well.
5,I will keep Angie in my prayers.
5,The only arrogance I personally see in Bush II is his language which places him and America as the representatives of Good capital G and our enemies as representatives of Evil capital E. This kind of language scares and enrages me regardless of the speaker.
5,Good luck to Chirs on the interview.
5,Unless he has been keeping a big secret or been spreading misinformation no.
5,Wow a debate with more than me and Mr. Wigglepants involved.
5,Disclaimer: The ideological phallus of which I spoke or rather the waving of such refers primarily to government officials of all stripes and the numerous pundits and talking heads who appear in the various media.
5,Question -- 'We must engage the parts of the world that hate us' -- is that what we're about to do with the 101st Airborne Yikes indeed.
5,Thanks for the dance response -- I understood it better than the previous post.
5,And and.... Mir -- I hope you are feeling better soon.
5,And we are addressing (kida) the deed with Iraq leaving the reason for later -- but if you are fighting a fire in an oil rig you have to put out the flames before you can shut off the oil flow....
5,And let's run with the World Dance Party scenario: Yes we're at a party and yes we're playing some pretty rockin' dance music (the remix of Oingo Boingo's 'Dead Man's Party' sounds pretty good to me right now...) and yes we'd love for everyone to dance.
5,'I liked Reaganomics a lot -- it's got a good beat and I can dance to it.'
5,well mr. wigglepants since i have no health insurance it is difficult for me to see a doctor.
5,Johnathan just much more aptly illustrated the point I was trying to make in my most recent post.
5,Miriam -- have you seen a doctor or are you hoping one will appear in your drug-induced haze
5,i have had the flu since friday night.
5,Bear in mind that I am not at all articulate about such things but I have to say that I don't like the image presented by CK's argument.
5,Sadly I think you are right in the solution of wiping all extremists out but that will not happen nor should it.
5,Clarification: I do not define appeasement by addressing an attacker's complaints while simultaneously exacting wholesale and decisive retaliation for that individual's attack which is the argument I am making.
5,And you posted twice too :) Missed you today...hope you're feeling better soon hon...
5,hey guys - i had the flu today - threw up twice hurrah sorry i missed the game.
5,If I am understanding you correctly you think the heart of their hatred for the USA is related to our support for Israel and the presence of troops in Saudi Arabia.
5,If we don't have anything the fire ants want they go away.
5,If we prod the nest of fire ants we get swarmed.
5,what we need right now is a well thought out and cutting rebuttal from mr. chris king.
5,To clarify: I said the Bush administration had a strong case but exchanged it for weaker one.
5,I'm sure this will surprise few (if any) of you.
5,Regardless of one's opinion regarding Iraq it is undeniable that should individuals or groups decide to retaliate it will be us -- you me our families our friends -- who will be the favored target.
5,from an article in the washington post No definitive price tag or time limit has been put on the plan and officials stressed that much remains unknown about the length of a potential conflict how much destruction would result and 'how deep' the corruption of the Iraqi government goes.
5,op ed from the ny times February 21 2003 The Martial Plan By PAUL KRUGMAN he Marshall Plan was America's finest hour.

5,now i desperately want to play risk - and i'm not going to hold back next time.
5,We continue to avoid the strongest argument: Even though Asia is worth 7 armies there are only three reasons to hold the Middle East: (1) as a buffer for holding Africa (2) as a buffer for holding Europe (though the Ukraine and Southern Europe are the weaker points); and (3) as a launching point for the seizing of Australia.

5,'...U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warns Syria that the U.S. considers military shipments to Iraq a 'hostile act.''
5,Come on conservatives 120000 more ground troops are on the way Soon hundreds maybe thousands will be gassed or diseased and your suspicions will be quickly and effectively proved true The Arab world trembles before our might and no terrorist would ever think of striking back now that they've seen how strong we are And democracy is about to dawn across the Middle East Yet the Blog remains silent Come on kids -- this is your day Speak up Praise Attack Gloat Something
5,The liberals post links and dye their hair while the conservatives remain silent....

5,Looks like another 120000 troops will be on their way soon How big is our military anyway I have no idea.
5,I'd comment but someone may be eavesdropping.
5,Okay...here's my two cents which is sort of a war offshoot.

5,Oooooh but what a pair it was baby -- the flames could be seen for miles
5,angie - could you please check your email - and i bleached it on sunday dyed black on monday and for an update on the hypothetical situation presented earlier: after begging and pleading with his boss and humilating himself entirely he was able to get the time off and can now meet my parents.
5,No no -- share your petty rage And I will share my petty foreboding.
5,thank you so much for your insight sir happyslacks - i will be sure to keep my petty rage to myself from now on.
5,I think you should get really really really mad because that always makes things better.
5,oh and he was supposed to meet your parents for the first time and your parents were making a special effort to be there and had to take time off work in order to be at this prearranged dinner.
5,question: let's say someone does something unintentionally and pisses you off.
5,Do you mean human beings in general or just Americans
5,An observation: We seem unable to function without fear.
5,my hair is bright yellow and actually looks much better than it did yesterday at the game.
5,thought this might infuriate john and chris; inspire ben and well i guess just me and ben - Director Moore criticizes U.S.-Iraq war March 23 2003 | Michael Moore criticized President Bush and the U.S.-led war in Iraq during his acceptance speech at Sunday's Academy Awards drawing a partial standing ovation and some jeers from Hollywood's elite.
5,Black was probably a respect for the war/soldiers thing I'm thinking.
5,Now that some of you from the game have watched the Oscars...do you NOW believe me when I say Renee Zellweger is a twig Pretty dress though.
5,Chris - Do you really need my answers You should know them already.
5,My head spins with the fast-moving dialogue on this here blog.
5,Just got home from it an hour ago still exhausted...went well...LONG day...more later.
5,hey ang how did your audition go
5,Mir: Please tell me you don't really believe that oil is the reason we are at war.
5,The Independent Speaks: In this case I would much prefer conservatives proved right than liberals proved right.
5,The fog of war appears to have silenced the blog...
5,Seen on a discussion board: 'Wow this lag is terrible.
5,The Dune and Raiders references re: a sandstorm and divine intervention on the eve of a war with religious undertones struck me as amusing.
5,Got an email from my mom -- she says these points are from Dennis Miller (tho I doubt it) but the selected ones below elicited a chuckle: 1.
5,Anyone care to lay odds on whether the French embassy in Baghdad will be 'accidently' destroyed during the bombing campaign or during the street fighting John -- SciFi is not the issue -- access to the VCR is.
5,I wonder how many Countdown parties are happening this evening.
5,False start The Army is reporting that 17 Iraqi soldiers have surrendered to US troops in Kuwait.
5,Jones: Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.
5,Chris - SciFi is replaying the entire Children of Dune miniseries from 5pm to 11pm on Sunday.
5,To each his own John :) S'all good.
5,Re: Those skinny frogs: They walk a lot too.
5,Angie - I took absolutely no offense at your post.
5,you should see what happens when I dress like a matador
5,In my opinion America has given the world two unique things of lasting value: (1) jazz and (2) jeans (though this could be expanded to 'The West' in general).
5,Oh I wouldn't consider myself all that high fashion or in-crowd either...I just know names and products but I can't afford any of it.
5,without a doubt i agree with angie regarding the kiss guys.
5,The KISS boys look stupid without their makeup.
5,I bristle when it is suggested that in the whole spectrum of human thinking there are only conservatives liberals and moderates.
5,Besides it is an 'Army of One' afterall... LOL
5,i like to listen to this song when i begin to feel overwhelmed or highly stressed: i have listened to it 3 times today.
5,I AM GRAMMARIAN HULK FEAR ME
5,How did they not notice before then You'd think you'd feel something like that...like when people get tumors that are the size of grapefruits...did they get that big overnight or are people just too stupid to notice a freakin' mass growing on their bodies
5,I don't know if that's disgusting or miraculous or just plain weird.
5,ack....hate grammar site....must kill engineering students...yesssss.... much simpler than correcting stupid grammatical errors....
5,That's...just...I'm too incredulous to respond to that.
5,A glimpse of the Capital One intranet website: Featured Value of the week: Integrity How to put Integrity into practice every day April 29 2003 Integrity is a Value that everyone has the ability to practice.
5,Stay on target [munch munch slurp].
5,Well John you didn't have to click on it if you don't live in the angieverse.
5,Star Wars VII: The Fate of Porkins
5,ENOUGH WITH THE DISTORTED DOGS I was watching Star Wars for the 10000th time the other night and I think I caught a little continuity gaff.
5,this may 10th dinner party and music fest seems like it will the largest group ever the list thus far: (of those confirmed) miriam richard ben jorelle johnathan angie tracy tracy's girlfriend (i don't believe that is her actual name) michaux greg grant mmm... that's only 11. am i missing someone hmmmmmm.....
5,Man wears name tag: To make the world a friendlier place ST. LOUIS (AP) Hello his name is Scott.
5,And there's nothing wrong with PCs -- if I were a full-bore gamer with time to do such a thing I'd certainly have a PC system for the wealth of available games.
5,Apple is working on a PC version of iTunes.
5,harmony trying to thumb his nose at us pish-posh - couldn't happen.
5,Are you trying to thumb your nose at us Harmony The fine print (ok it's not so fine) at the bottom says you must have a Mac operating OS X. I think you are the only here that meets those requirements.
5,I just dreamed that this guy I work with was antagonizing me and kept trying to steal my wig ().
5,Sounds like someone is finding healing in the arms of the Dream King.
5,yes you are correct the first part was definitely meant as a joke.a negative self-image can exist at any age.
5,I doubt that a negative self-image is limited only to children due for recess nor that it can be easily dismissed as immaturity.
5,For the record the two 'tall ones' are around 5'7' or 5'8' according to my cursory online research.
5,Mir -- So if I saw an entertainer who you think looks like you and I described her in an insulting way would that bother you Just a hypothetical.
5,please john don't pass out but i agree with you on this.
5,Perhaps the problem lies in our language.
5,today sam is spending his last day looking out the window and wanting to be petted.
5,As I posted a week or so ago I am not a huge cat person.
5,Miriam...my cat Pookie was 14 years old when he was diagnosed with FIV and he had a stroke which caused him to lose the use of his back legs.
5,my cat sam who i have had for 12 years was diagnosed today with renal failure and i will have to put him to sleep tomorrow.
5,They blew it all to shit anway so what does it matter now Who the fuck is Qui-Gon I love Liam but damn.
5,Now that I think of it there's no continuity trouble with Chewbacca appearing in III and IV.
5,John - does your question about advance notice reference the Buddhist carvings If so yes - there was a long build-up; I remember following it.
5,B5 Season 2 on DVD - 4/29/03 Chewbacca to be in Episode III.
5,Miriam (Congratulations BTW) you are making some gross as in large assumptions concerning the looting.
5,Perhaps I am not being clear.
5,I appreciate your opinion re: the issue of liberating the Iraqi people from a ruthless dictator.
5,Ok you're right about the slippers.
5,that's not entirely my point harmony.
5,Do you think if America were invaded and the government overthrown that we would have looted the Smithsonian 'Dammit I just GOTTA have Dorothy's Ruby Slippers Now's my chance'
5,So it is our responsibility to protect people from looting or destroying their own nation's culture and history
5,i would think that people are upset about the looting of the iraqi's muesums because the u.s. military did nothing to protect them.
5,Clarificaton: I am specifically addressing the artifact/museum issue.
5,I've been thinking about this...how exactly is it our fault if Iraqis loot their own historical artifacts They're not our children.
5,I dig on my tan-in-a-can tan.
5,thought i would share something from my online journal: 2/25/2003 12:13:22 AM | bouncy bouncy] i was thinking about johnathan - about my friends - about life.
5,(doorbell) (answers door) Yes Arf (closes door) (doorbell) Yes (sees sign around dog's neck - in messy crayon) (tilts head reads) Sarah...Connor Yes I'm Sarah Connor.
5,Picturing that dog driving a semi into anything has got to be the funniest shit I've thought about all day.
5,That's what they all say...right before he drives a semi headlong into the steel factory where you're hiding.
5,Awwwwww....bwess his widdle heawt yes he did get all hurted and stuff....
5,Actually if you check CNN almost
5,a fairly inept terminator though wouldn't you say
5,From CNN: 'Dog hit by car shot by cop left for dead -- and lives' Little did they know that this was no dog -- it was the new T-201 a killing machine sent back from a dark future programmed for a single deadly purpose....
5,borderline feels like I'm going to lose my mind you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
5,okay waaaaay too much information about johnathan at cap one.
5,That scene describes many of my days since the first time Johnathan asked me...and the subsequent times he asked...although it may have been a Backstreet Boys shirt.
5,yes you are correct angie - another error.
5,If I weren't naked I'd run around working.
5,Go ahead and tentatively add Tracy (my brother) and Julie (his girlfriend).
5,and yes there are many misspellings in my posts.
5,list thus far for may 10th dinner - miriam richard ben joriel johnathan angie liz (punchline) pete (punchline) michaux greg rebecca brennan chris and mystery date..... ;) others have been invited - who will accept jimi tree john and even more have been invited who haven't quite confirmed yet and remember this extragant affair will be taking place at pasta luna (we're crazy about pasta) at 7pm on May 10th.

5,you both have lost yoru monds
5,my hair is covered in hemp
5,everybody run / the homecoming queen's got a gun
5,i love you more than i can say.
5,always gotta rain on my destiny parade don't you
5,I didn't say you would want to meet it...
5,my first question: are you going to tell us the truth or merely lies
5,5) Will the male 12-year-old target audience ever figure out that their fantasy hottie is old enough to be their mother 6) Will Neo recreate the Matrix to resemble the world of Point Break 7) Will Morpheus tell anyone about his hidden stash of cheeseburgers
5,Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.
5,I could also have had an obtuse moment.
5,I caught it the first time.
5,Babylon 5 Season 3 -- August 12
5,He's the fellow who Smith blends with before he can reach the phone.
5,spoiler for those of you who havne't seen matrix reloaded: i didn't know this until i read it on this modern world: the guy at the end is the 'human' agent smith i totally missed it while watching it.
5,In a recent interview Joss shares the irony that he was able to tell the story he wanted to tell in the Buffy movie -- about a ditzy and self-absorbed girl becoming heroic -- through Cordelia from her run on 'Buffy' through to her arc on 'Angel'.
5,The multiple Agent Smiths was the kind of thing I had hoped we'd see in Episode II.
5,Oh Jesus that would have been funny.
5,in the scene with the multiple mr. smiths i kept waiting for them to break out into sometype of line kicking routine.
5,I've been going through the motions Walking through the part Nothing seems to penetrate my heart
5,I also enjoyed the fight scenes.
5,I liked watching people kick ass.
5,look at my supple french breasts and i will tell you everything you wish to know.
5,Oh silly of course I know I'm important I appreciate the thought but it's really okay to go on without me.
5,I'm sure Angie appreciates her importance and the game will not be postponed.
5,why don't we just postpone the game until finney can join us i don't think waiting another 2 weeks would kill anyone.
5,Johnathan's right...I will sadly be unable to join you all at Sunday's game.
5,The good news is Angie is very pleased with the results -- not only will her Movement rate increase by 5 but she won't have to lose the 'Great Cleavage' feat.
5,From what I can gather as an observer the effect of breast reduction surgery is similar to being hit square and full force in the chest with a baseball bat.
5,Are you going to show us on Sunday ;) Wait a sec....
5,Thanks guys for all the support.
5,One can always count on Madonna to keep abreast of current blog postings.
5,tried that - they kept getting out of the pot.
5,You could just make stew of them for Richard tonight; say they're at a friend's house.
5,i'm watching my 2 stepchildren today and they are trying me nuts.
5,good idea johnathan and quite tasty.
5,From The Washington Post summarized in The Week: About 40000 human embryos are being stored in freezers in fertility clinics throughout the U.S.
5,i would say his since he actually wrote the script.
5,JS -- take care of that woman my friend.
5,Angie came out of surgery fine and asked me to give a shout out to the bloggers.
5,witness the eerie silence and tremble my fellow bloggers and geeks....
5,and i may be a so-so girlfriend but i am a kick-ass ex-girlfriend.
5,i think ben was just trying to be funny about the buffy stuff - i remember when it was basically just ben and me on the blog everyday and i'm sure he is thrilled that the blog is so active and people have something to say.
5,Chris - I did see Farscape from time to time.
5,Enterprise - With the more serious overtones being set up for next season does anyone think that we may be seeing the beginnings of the Empire instead of the Federation
5,Ben - Your post struck a nerve which surprises me.
5,my thoughts and wishes are with angie today.
5,I watched the last episode of Buffy.
5,You awake with an upset stomach in bed with Pat Buchanan.
5,what would happen if you took the blue pill and the red pill at the same time awareness without action action without thought
5,I wonder if I will ever be in a villain's clutches.
5,CK - Since I am purchasing the B5 DVDs as they are released I do not need the VHS tapes anymore.
5,I'm sure that if the blog existed when B5 was on the air -- or Twin Peaks before that -- there would be just as many commentaries questions and complaints.
5,i was starting to seriously consider setting up a second 'buffy blog' for you guys - but then i realized that if i did this blog would be empty until the series was over.
5,The only discrepancy in the whole article that troubled me was Bush's insistence that he initially watched it on television if the evidence shows he did not.
5,I agree with Johnathan about the stupidity of his being robbed of choice in the end.
5,I was wondering how you were doing today Angie.
5,Ben - I read some of the article and skimmed other parts.
5,Spike is dead and I'm having a shit day.
5,I agree with some of your points and disagree with others.
5,as far as all the potential slayers becoming slayers at the same time i don't think that was heavy-handed or took away from the message of personal empowerment.
5,I enjoyed Buffy's solution and a few of the exchanges.
5,so you did or did not like the finale harmony i loved it.
5,oh yeah i laughed so hard - they were playing d&d and making a homestar runner reference.
5,Why is it so hard to create a movie or television episode that gives me more than a few really good moments Why are writers so lazy that they expect me to fill in the blanks Why do writers receive so much notoriety not for being very careful and attentive to the story but for succeeding in climbing awkwardly out of the corner into which they have painted themselves Always always always leave the party when everyone is having a good time.
5,Ok so of my list of fatalities I got one and a half right - Spike and Anya.
5,OK peeps catching up on the blog (and I didn't have to go all the way to the bottom of the 100 post view) JS -- I realized tonight that I still have your video tape with Season 3 of B5 (Angie's Journey caused the lightbulb to fizzle on).
5,10 minutes until the end of buffyverse.
5,3 hours 45 minutes to the end of Buffy.
5,why threat level orange i thought it was threat level tangerine.
5,Threat level orange Threat level orange
5,i just checked the mirror and you harmony the june bug are correct
5,I thought it was an octality theory.
5,i'm probably becoming fascinated by minutia here but the 'upper / lower case' labeling interests me.
5,i feel it coming upon me - like ivy creeping up the walls of harvard like mold growing on the walls of a public bathroom like litter flaking slowly from a cat's paw - it's dinner party time again time - first weekend of august - (first saturday) place - mekong who's invited - everybody everybody
5,i suppose in some ways i'm a sucker for ben's chaos/order duality theory.
5,I agree -- illustrating extremes is an effective way to reveal the uncertain middle.
5,i agree that there are no absolutes and none should be attempted.
5,Two cents: wrong and evil and for that matter right and good are not the same thing.
5,in response: i am aware of the difference between the upper and lower case 'republican' and 'democrat.'
5,r/R d/D: The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.
5,I have observed that Social Darwinists are often ignorant of the interdependencies that got them where they are.
5,JLS - i've not heard of the difference between 'upper-' and 'lower-case' democracts and republicans.
5,part of the difficulty one faces with bringing such arguments to certain republican mindsets: sometimes you're dealing with social darwinists who believe that only the strong will (and should) survive.
5,I was with you until the last sentence.
5,to bring up a topic that was introduced yesterday during game - you need to have good educational system in order to form a peaceful and strong society.
5,i just got back from ben's house wheee
5,Difficult to type -- ears bleeding --
5,because so far i've listened to it 2000 times.
5,yay did you like the audioblog thing
5,I am in your house right now
5,and my phone isn't working - i'm here though
5,okay that is too funny... and aren't you supposed to be at my house in about 10 minutes
5,or you mo-fos can't join my posse if you got a prob with bro-bro love dig
5,american association of law schools will not permit a school to join which discrimates against homosexuals during the job-interview process which is a very important part of the law school experience for the students.
5,'I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.'
5,Same reason why Batman can't turn his head.
5,Justice Scalia's (who may be chief justice soon) opinion on the same case: June 27 2003 | Today's opinion is the product of a Court which is the product of a law-profession culture that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.
5,I mean I like what the guy said and his actual words made perfect sense but what's it's context I have no information about the case to which this pertains.
5,Ummm....what Where did this come from and what does it all mean man
5,Following are excerpts from Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas handed down June 26.
5,i just the new madonna video 'hollywood' and that is embarrassing for everyone involved.

5,You dressed up as Threepio I cannot even begin to wrap my head around the unbearably goobish cuteness of the image that conjurs.
5,Borders Books+Music on West Broad is going all out with the imminent Harry Potter volume.

5,i can't tell you how much better that makes me feel.
5,If it's any consolation that is not the final song from Grease which is actually 'We Go Together.'
5,i have the final song from grease going through my head and it won't stop.
5,Going to cancun before the wedding But...that's....that's....why you'll be living in sin
5,for those of you who don't know my wedding has been postponed until next april or something like that.
5,...in the land of Marriage where the Husbands lie.
5,sharp ring - but of course i liked the other ring too.
5,In the old days women just gestured more with their left hands.
5,Don't be fooled by the rocks that she got She's still she's still Angie from the block We be engaged Or rather more so than before.
5,oh yeah i got my cable modem back funky chicken.
5,okay i have just figured out how to use this - so it looks fine - the new template makes me cry.
5,Whoa Ben got a new template Looks good bro With the all new system do they have new templates now 'Cause a lot of the old ones sucked.
5,Yelahneb - neither the most current version of IE for Mac nor Mac's own new browser Safari display Blogger normally.
5,BACH I was howling when I read the Plush Cthulu Tale.
5,Well I guess I have a more updated version of IE at home than I do at work because I am not stuck with the crappy Lo-Fi sht.
5,JLS - i don't think the OS is the issue; the message you received was 'This version of Blogger has been designed for web browsers that lack robust Stylesheet and/or DHTML capabilities.'
5,The Chewie thing is so retarded that I can't even think about it.
5,i read the whole story ben and it was bizarre.
5,i tell you what people - cavalier dsl sucks
5,The new Blog design must be for XP users -- neither my 95 PC at work nor my OS X Mac at home can view the page in anything other than 'Blogger LoFi.'
5,Harmony -- yes I have focused on my breathing in such a way from time to time.
5,they afraid that if it's legalized they won't be able to resist that temptation to go out and fuck other men.
5,What could possibly be so threatening about same-gender marriage that the Executive branch is expending the time and energy to outlaw it -- Annoyed Republican
5,i haven't but i have at times become hyper-aware of color and wondered if there are colors i've never seen before.
5,Have you ever become so aware of your own breathing that for a brief moment you become terrified that if you stop consciously thinking about it your body won't do it on its own
5,ummm...what I have to wait 'til I get home to hear AudBlog posts...dammit I'm missing out on all the fun And that onion article...WTF
5,calling all angies calling all angies - are we on for tuesday night angie over
5,Bob Hope finally cashed it in.
5,There was a blog on the 'recently published' list just now that was called 'My Boyfriend is a Twat.'
5,maybe i've been reading your site or following you around and secretly listening to you - either way.
5,Dude you just posted the lyrics to an Air Supply song.
5,i'm not moving to nova until next june.
5,The Police reference the Scylla and Charybdis in 'Wrapped Around Your Finger' Mir.
5,what the hell are you talking about harmony
5,NoVa and Capital One The Scylla and Charybdis of central Virginia
5,i'm not sure if that's going to work - the poopoo head comment is only so effective.
5,GAH Don't leave us Mir Tell Richard he's a big poopoo stinkyhead if he takes away our Mir pouts
5,richard's ex-bitch is taking the kids up to the maryland/dc area so jack (he has autism) can get proper treatment which is not available in va unless you happen to have 55000 dollars laying around to pay for it.
5,Why on earth would you do that and if you must when What the hell is going on I'm so confused.
5,i don't want to move to NoVA
5,How does it feel How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone
5,There are some people in this world to whom you could give a wheelbarrow full of gold ore and they'd complain that it was too heavy.
5,Re: drum circle epiphany...Ben I can only HOPE you were stoned when you recorded that...
5,Good night Was that Johnathan laughing like a maniac
5,Here in this place I have no sound
5,so no one was amused by the old JLS voicemail i love it.
5,Johnathan you are such a sick puppy.
5,And I liked the new Strong Bad email.
5,Dude like NONE of my friends on Blogger or LJ are posting anything.
5,the new strong bad email - not so good.
5,and sometimes people do very brave and wonderful things - strange world.
5,i tell you what people will spaz over the strangest things.
5,you are such a freak ben.
5,Did you mean to post the same story twice
5,richard and i will be unable to go - we have the boys this weekend - and since i'm going to be gone all weekend i'd like to spend some time with them.
5,i do indeed have to work and will miss the fun; i thought perhaps others might want to go though.
5,Angie and I will not be able to attend.
5,Perhaps but that is not my point.
5,but without free will there are no options; just the illusion of choice exists.
5,Free will always results in loss of control.
5,If it helps red I was put here to test you.
5,red - perhaps you could start by thinking about the design on your back.
5,That's oen of the reasons why I believe in God...'cause I feel like too much happens that seems to be meant for the enlightenment of myself and others.
5,really do you ever feel like there are people or situations in the world that exist to test you i know that claims alot of ego because that would mean that somewhere in the universe someone or something is concerned about your individual enlightenment - but it does seem that way sometimes.
5,i suppose my question is then how do we get the two to harmonize
5,Unless emotion and intellect are in harmony it is unlikely one knows at all.
5,why is it we can know something so firmly and completely intellectually but still be unable to comprehend it emotionally
5,For that matter one could say all ideologies are absolutist.
5,Cameron Frye was the legendary best friend of Ferris.
5,Mir my dear...liberals are also absolutistic.
5,conversatives do have the advantages of being absolutistic
5,For those who go to Shore Leave and feel there's nothing to do in the town we saw/found: 4 sushi restaurants several seafood restaurants several Italian restaurants a delightful polynesian sno-cone shop multiple pubs a tobacconist a nifty aquarium specialty store an ice cream vendor a huge 50s-style diner with 24-hour breakfasts of massive proportions dozens of antique stores a hobby shop several consignment shops a nice non-chain bookstore and a giant fox.
5,Hve you seen 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'
5,How could you not be for REAL excited about a giant dancing rat Chuck E. Cheese owns.

5,I thought Nick's post was clear and well stated.
5,harmony are we having a game this sunday
5,My point is not that the Ten Commandments are old but rather that they were traditionally authored by Yahweh the god of the Hebrews in the Old Testament and to refer to them as a starting point in our legal theory is to make inseperable our society's laws and the aforementioned deity.
5,Nick - I'm not ignoring your post or your points but I need sometime to make sure that my response is a cogent as your post.
5,Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
5,I was pretty sure that you were but I wanted to see what was written about the subject.
5,Johnathan - In one of your responses concerning the Ten Commandements you stated (correctly) that you are not a 13th century BCE Hebrew implying to me that you did not think that something proposed 3300 years ago has no place in today's society because we have changed over time.
5,Does anyone know if the actor Steven Culp is the son of Robert Culp He currently has three recurring roles on three different shows on three different networks (Clayton Webb on JAG; the Speaker of the House on the West Wing; the MACO major on Enterprise).

5,Self observation: How curious that when I am talking with my fellow citizens I tend to doubt key elements of my government's foreign policy; yet when I encounter someone from another country who voices similar opinions I bristle and feel compelled to defend it.
5,Then Santa will come after all God bless us every one
5,nick - you sound like a very intelligent guy - nice to have that represented on the blog.
5,I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch.
5,john - i don't think the issue here is whether our laws have a judeo-christian origin or not.
5,One can only hope that the debunking from AICN towards the bottom of this posting is true.
5,I have flag sticker in my cube that was left behind by the previous occupant.
5,The Ten Commandments are the product of a 13th century BCE religion and culture regardless of the message and to place them on government property suggests that we should accept the deity Yahweh or Jehovah as our single original source of law.
5,Yeah but then you would have laws passed against attempted flag burning and impersonating a flag (TIC)
5,Johnathan - Who said anything about a theocracy Would the commandments be better accepted if the one about honor no other God before me (or something to that effect) was not listed What is wrong with telling people to not kill one another respect their parents don't steal don't bear false witness against your neighbor and don't cover your neighbor's possessions I seem to recall that most states have laws against taking another's life (except for the State itself with capital punishment).
5,Perhaps one could create a cloth flag that lacks one stripe or several stars and set that on fire.
5,john: ok i'm going to pick on you now.
5,The protest wasn't against the war.
5,Meanwhile this headline from CNN: 'Police await Michael Jackson's surrender' How does one catch a Smooth Criminal
5,Does any country know how to solve complex problems It seems analogous to hoping that a single wave will reshape a coastline.
5,i agree with you johnathan - it does seem silly to protest a war that has happened and what exactly is the message now that we couldn't really leave without causing more chaos than before.
5,I am not a 13th century BCE Hebrew.
5,What Am I as your soon-to-be-wife not considered a fellow blogger I know who Michael Kamen is monkey...I remember him not only from his film scores but from that great performance of 'Dream On' he did with Aerosmith for MTV's tenth anniversary special.
5,Johnathan - Sadly I don't recognize the name.
5,Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal.
5,the image created in my mind from the last bit got me: 'Home Secretary David Blunkett has refused to grant diplomatic immunity to armed American special agents and snipers travelling to Britain as part of President Bush's entourage this week.
5,JLS: feel what way specifically nick and eva: interesting about the statue bit; excellent street theater.
5,Film composer Michael Kamen died of a heart attack recently.

5,what is up with you and shrugging ben and john i think there's got to be some professionals (engineers and the like) in iraq who could be used in this process.

5,Johnathan - I agree with the similarities between 2004 and 1996 with regards to the motivations of the political parties.
5,i think that most of the work to build up iraq should be given to iraqi companies or/and as many iraqis as possible should be employed for these projects.

5,Can you believe it If someone had told me we'd hit the 100 degree mark for the first time June 2nd I would have said right sure we will.
5,You ever get up and almost immediately you know it's going to be one of those days Welp today is one of those days.
5,Exercise your democratic right and get out and vote OK just because someone found the Shania voucher doesn't mean the blog is closing down.
5,I can't beleived someone found the voucher already I am amazed that someone could find it from those clues.
5,First of all let me say I am not immune to the pain the family of the woman tragically killed last July 4th in a police pursuit here in Clovis.
5,You know I have been here at the radio station for almost 10 years now and for that entire time the trash can in the kitchen area has been in the same place.
5,The Tampa Bay Lightning are the Stanley Cup Champions My new favorite team took the cup with a 2-1 win over the Calgary(Alberta Canada...Lance Storm anyone) Flames last night.
5,by the weekend passing of the greatest president in our country's recent history.
5,Well on one hand I am glad to see the Supreme Court tell this putz Michael Newdow to go home but on the other I am disappointed they didn't make a stand and tell him to permanently go away that 'One nation under God' does not violate the seperation of church and state.
5,If you have logged on here recently looking for some pearls of wisdom or something remotely enlightening or even mildly humorous my apologies.
5,It never ceases to amaze me how unproductive I can be when I set my mind to it.
5,So the terrorists in Saudi Arabia have beheaded another American.
5,So the price for the life of a 2 week old girl is now 14 years eh If you haven't heard the individual that crashed his semi into he back of a car near Elida last August killing the 2 week old daughter of the couple inside was sentenced to 14 years in prison.
5,Went last night to the midnight premiere of Spider-Man 2.
5,Something bothers me about the 14 year old that killed his father stepmother and stepsister on Sam Donaldson's ranch near Hondo.
5,Haven't posted anything in a week and it's because not much has happened I guess.
5,Someone please explain to me how someone can become so far gone as to set their 3 children on fire along with their mother and themselves If you didn't hear a guy in Seattle poured gas on himself and his ex-girlfriend and their 3 children ages 6 months 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 as they were driving down the road.
5,I'm not even sure where to begin because nothing of really extreme significance has occured yet a lot of significant things have happened.
5,First starting Monday morning I will begin doing a tried and true radio thang called 'Pick It or Flick It'.
5,I am so proud of myself...for the second day in a row my show this morning was completely live Now you say to yourself 'Self what does he mean I listen to him and he sounds alive usually.
5,Well I certainly hope you guys missed me otherwise why the hell did I come back from vacation Went to Conchas Lake and did some fishing for a few days and caught a whopping 2 perch that could have been twins.
5,The Pick It or Flick It for your TGIF is: Montgomery Gentry--'You Do Your Thing' Exercise your democratic right and vote Pick it or flick it what shall it be

3,The weekdays rolled on too fast to me that at the end of it I realized that the weekend was not planned properly.
3,Last weekend turned out to be another memorable weekend for me.
3,This weekend I didnt spend much time outside and from the few places I went the predominant theme seemed to be my pet pondering Death.
3,With thoughtful books to read With soulful music to hear With beautiful places to stroll With intellectual art and sculpture to tickle my mind Paris is a paradise Sitting at the banks of River Seine Wear Lucky Ali on your ears Hold the little finger of Victor Hugo and ask him to walk you through his woods of ideas and now you know how heaven would feel like Wanting a change from monuments churches and museums I started my weekend with Bois de Bologne.
3,Thanks to Nellai(Nellaiappan Soundarrajan) for lending me his laptop to record my thoughts over the weekend.I missed gvim for Windows always expects her users to be pretty dumb I would love to live and die in Paris for it treats me so well even though I have no ideals to live upto or die for.

1,Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power yeah Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what’s within And I been there before but that’s life’s a bore so full of the superficial Chorus: Some people want it all but I don’t want nothing at all If it aint you baby if I aint got you baby Some people want diamond rings some just want everything But everything means nothing if I aint got you yeah Some people search for a fountain The promise is forever young (You know) Some people need 3 dozen roses And that’s the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter And what good would it be With no one to share with no one who truly cares for me Chorus: Some people want it all but I don’t want nothing at all If it aint you baby if I aint got you baby Some people want diamond rings some just want everything But everything means nothing if I aint got you you you Some people want it all but I don’t want nothing at all If it aint you baby if I aint got you baby Some people want diamond rings some just want everything But everything means nothing if I aint got you yeah If aint got you with me baby ohh ooo Say nothing in this whole wide world don’t mean a thing If I aint got you with me baby.

3,Okay here are a couple of more links to articles (both positive and negative) on 'Sex and the City'.
3,Hey ladies I just wanted to post a link to a website that contains a lot of discussion on 'The L Word'.
3,Hi everyone It's the last week Sylvie will be here and one of the last for Natalie as well.
3,Hi guys Sorry for the short notice but I got quite a good idea for this week.
3,Salut à toutes Hello This tuesday i would like to talk about sports.
3,My name is Greg and this is my story.
1,I have this love hate relationship with Solitaire.
1,You fear what's behind the door He's passed out on the floor Needle in his arm Blood on his chest.
1,Failure to see Inability to be You are a guiding light for me.
1,I mean seriously I have my own webspace with access to my friend's free home grown blogger why the hell am I using this google thing maybe its because nobody knows this is here and I'll just use this as an updatable spot for my work which is mainly poetry of some sort.
1,Clearly breathing but not alive In this poor excuse for a show tune Seething desires behind clockwork fires made by people who just don't care.
1,Even though your brain seems scarred And kept behind ageless bars For solitary is just to good for you.
1,Walking through the downtown of your brain Looking for the store of your dreams Where the last peice of your sanity is for sale And you smile over the counter As I charge it to my heart.
1,Bathe in these flames My thoughts yours for keeping Still my mind is slowly creeping Out of my eyes blind to the lies That you're weaving Slowly my mind keeps on creeping.
1,Ah but dear reader the question is not who am I but simply who are you You are here reading these very words for a reason known only to yourself.
1,As senior year approaches I've been thinking a lot about how I stack up against my peers in terms of maturity.
1,I realized today that I am an addict to Minesweeper.
1,...and there was something strangely refreshing about it.
1,I'm starting a weekly column here.
1,The four horsemen are assembled and the charge will begin.
1,Could my fellow horsemen copy some of my interests I keep clicking them and realizing that I'm alone... so alone... Don't tell me you don't like a good hunk of man-liver every once in a while.
1,which took more guts than it really should've.
1,The anticipation for Ken's first post is killing me.
1,This is a shout out to our only reader Shakeer.
1,For the last two weeks I have really been looking forward to this weekend because there is a dodgeball tournament at a high school near my house.
1,Me being me take my posts with a grain of salt.
1,As you can see Ken has joined and Mike and John will soon follow.
1,This blog has had technical difficulties for the past few days but they are now sorted out so we shall soon have two of the three new bloggers posting.
1,I recently got a brand new kickball.
1,The free iTunes song this week is good.
1,Just writing to explain the title.
1,This is not your father's blog.
3,When I went to do a little digging into the root causes of jealousy as a phenomenon that occurs in more humans (and within ourselves) more times than we care to admit I was surprised to find the word ‘love’ absent from any arguments and theories attempting to explain the emotion.
3,There is a school of thought that claims that human beings are separated from animals by our ability to control instinct for without self-control we're just smarter monkeys.
3,My technologically retarded brain finally realised that I had blocked the Blogger.com cookies ages ago.
3,Pillowmint is a collaboration Blog between Vishal Parpia and Roma Ebrahim.
3,I'm not exactly holding the fort either work has exploded into a hideous cocktail of 30 different things that need my immediate attention.
3,My deepest apologies for being so neglectful to the baby.
3,I like the fact that they killed the President.
3,Been messing about with ASP.Net and was having trouble getting CustomValidators to work correctly.
3,I don't even have to say what the fuck.
3,Finally the LZW compression patent runs out and Unisys doesn't get it's grubby paws on money for every single application that uses GIF compression.
3,This is one of those 'Why didn't I think of that' sites.
3,There are those that have so little faith in the American judicial system that they think SCO actually has a case.
3,As usual Robert Cringely manages to blow away everyone by seeing something where others don't.
3,One of the most irritating and arcane aspects of the internet has always been the slow propagation of DNS records.
3,I cleaned the case of my iPod today and was surprised to find that the case had popped out on the side.
3,After a lot of hard work complicated JS ;-) and some nifty tricks I have completed the first version of CFX_JImage Studio to demo our latest Java Custom tag.
3,Here is something you might enjoy To boost our wonderful CFX_JImage tag and offer more 'Bang for your buck' we have developed a DHTML interface to the custom tag that people can use to either try the tag out or host online to quickly edit an image file on their server.
3,Peter is currently packaging up and writing the documentation for our latest CFX release on CFTagStore.com.
3,About 3 weeks ago I got an invite to GMail.
3,Just finished my latest assigned project for a client bang on time The code is safely written to CD and ready for deployment tomorrow.
3,We are always striving to make better applications here at Digital Crew.
3,Finally I have taken the plunge and started a ColdFusion Development Blog on the latest developments in ColdFusion personnally with Digital Crew and CFTagStore.com Seeing as this is the first post and I'm trying to work out what the hell is going on with the feeds and everything I'll keep it short and sweet I'll say this though the Interface for Blogger is savagely good Dan.

1,another sleepless night turns colors black and white twenty one days...
1,silence swinging by a thread to and fro and somehow the words echo before they are even spoken.
1,an infinate confusion begins the cracks in this green glass vase that is no longer green but blue a deep dark mourning cobalt blue.
1,do you know what I am thinking I am thinking far away.
1,Chantele and Bobby and I all went to see Pirates of the Carribean last night.
1,samarae00000 (8:13:02 PM): samarae00000 (8:13:10 PM): its a mousie samarae00000 (8:13:27 PM): it works better w/ a quiggly tail samarae00000 (8:13:38 PM): but this font goes samarae00000 (8:13:51 PM): hey it worked samarae00000 (8:13:56 PM): thats the real mouse samarae00000 (8:14:14 PM): wait samarae00000 (8:14:19 PM): that better samarae00000 (8:14:27 PM): the 3 is too big samarae00000 (8:14:35 PM): sigh I ran into the grocery store earlier and they had the prettiest roses out.
1,I blogged out on xanga... silly Rachel.
1,So I'm kind of behind on recent events but I really don't feel like typing out every thing that's happened in the past week or so... it hasn't exactly been a good week...
1,so I've been awake for two hours now.
1,so I've been remembering how I used to be.
1,Jimmy Eat World-- My Sundown I see it around me I see it in everything.
1,So I'm reading Margaret Atwood again... 'Out of the gravel there are peonies growing They come up through the loose grey pebbles their buds testing the air like snails' eyes then swelling and opening huge dark red flowers all shining and glossy like satin.
1,So I've been being really bad lately.
1,I told my chemistry teacher that I haven't been sleeping much lately and she was like ' Rachel that's bad.
1,for some reason I find that disturbing....
1,Notes on yesterday: I'm not sure you even noticed.
1,You know what's really bad When its only the second week of school and you're already so stressed out about school that you intentionally go to the library and get really dorky girly books about dorky girly teenage girls... who are dorky and girly {get the point} and always have adorable boyfriends and do the most dorky girly things that are so stupid you laugh out loud in your bedroom all by yourself when really you should be doing your chem lab instead of reading dorky girly books... and now I'm going to go attempt to go finish my chem lab... or maybe study for the Latin test
1,I am fully and completely exhausted.
1,Well I am an official Catholic on my own now.
1,beyond my wants... beyond my fears... what is this that I fear what is this that terrifies me so why so many questions yes yet another ironic isn't it the walls of my head are a prison.
1,well I really cried today... violent sobs yeah all that... it was really bad.
1,Goodnight I'm going to bed to see if I can sleep this off.
1,I need to escape from my house... will you come kidnap me please I'll tie my sheets together and I can climb out my window and then we can go sit out in the middle of nowhere and look at mars k
1,Ok so I'm getting really sick of my parents freaking out every time I want to do something.
1,can you tell my brain is fried today and I'm bored so I'm coming up with random things to post First best friend(s):Ryan... he was my next door neighbor First real memory of something: I think its riding our big wheels down the hill we used to live on a break neck speeds... First car: my lil' white mazda First date: um...well... that depends... First real kiss: oh... First job: working at my dad's office First screen name: um I think it was the one my dad came up with for me... Im4vball First self purchased album: um...
1,hmmmmmmmmmm...................... You have a mysterious kiss.
1,Interesting conversation I had today: Sarah was talking about how Chandler didn't seem her usual perky self today and then she said 'well but then again nobody's very perky today... except for you Rachel you're always perky.
1,Good Morning... did you know that its easier to sleep until eleven when its cloudy and the sun doesn't come up shining right in your window
1,So its that same question I've been asking since I was old enough to have my own identity {about third grade} Who am I really and who do I want to be Do I want to be the person I know people want me to be because I want other people to be happy and so I will be who I am to make them so Do I want to be the person I know my parents want me to be Do I want to be sweet and innocent Do I want to be strong and powerful Can I be both Do I want to be the person that can be depended on to always say 'Yes' Do I want to be the one people feel protective of and be 'babied' to a point Do I want to be the one who is wildly successful though has given up every thing else to be so WHO DO I WANT TO BE WHO AM I NOW am I who I've heard people think I am Am I really the one who {supposedly} when my best friend is having her first child will be in the amazon connected by cell phone yelling support Am I the graceful beauty some people say I am {though I see things quite differently} Am I as 'good' as I've heard others say {I know I'm not.}
1,So I had another revelation while I was driving with the radio off tonight.
1,I want for everything to just be fine for a while.
1,So yesterday I went to the Kansas City Art Institute to have my portfolio reviewed and I think it went really well.
1,ARG oh look I have 705 hits... that's a lot though not considering how long I've had that counter up.
1,So yeah now I'VE copied it... but I need to save it because I think its something I should read every now and again.
1,Are you gonna live your life wonderin' standing in the back lookin' around Are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you've grown up or how you missed out Things are never gonna be the way you want.
1,'It's dark as a stone in this room and hot as a roasting heart; if you atare into the darkness with your eyes open you are sure to see something after a time.
1,I'm having one of those nights.
1,I'm in the best mood today... and I had a lot of fun last night.
1,I think I'm having an identity crisis.
1,I'm getting kind of excited about NCYC.
1,I have way too much to do this weekend.
1,You know what I love This song: Switchfoot-- Meant to Live Fumbling his confidence And wond'ring why the world has passed him by Hoping that he's meant for more than arguments And failed attempts to fly fly We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves Somewhere we live inside Somewhere we live inside We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves Somewhere we live inside Dreaming about Providence And whether mice or men have second tries Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open Maybe we're bent and broken broken We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves Somewhere we live inside Somewhere we live inside We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves Somewhere we live inside We want more than this world's got to offer We want more than this world's got to offer We want more than the wars of our fathers And everything inside screams for second life We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves We were meant to live We were meant to live You know what else I love getting back my first roll of newspaper film and the majority of them are really good and they are ALL at least semi usable {can you say Photoshop} Ms. Rez calling me 'hon' which means she likes me which is neat because she's one of my favorite teachers.
1,when do I get my fairy tale
1,So Sama and Chantele and I have had a girls day out... it was fun... but now we're watching chik fliks... which all three of us have agreed have become horribly depressing... especially the kissing scenes...
1,Oh I wish for someone for you For you whom my heart whispers to in night When I am drowning in the darkness.
1,I feel really good about the past week.
1,This time I'm just going to sit and wait and take what comes to me.
1,Ok this song really is beautiful... its a duet on Matt Maher's cd called 'Set me as a Seal' Set me as a seal on your heart set me as a seal on your soul for strong as death is love unyielding as the grave.
1,for some reason I find this song just absolutely beautiful.
1,She said 'don't don't let it go to your head Boys like you are a dime a dozen Boys like you are a dime a dozen' She said 'you're a touch overrated you're a lush and I hate it but these grass stains on my knees they won't mean a thing' And all I (all I) Need to know (need to know) Is that I'm somethin you'll be missin (is that I'm somethin that you're missin) (maybe I should hate for this) Maybe I should hate you for this Never really did ever quite get that far (maybe I should hate for this) Maybe I should hate you for this Never really did ever quite get that...
1,jazzboyj99 [7:43 PM]: so have you recovered from NCYC Soybeenchik847 [7:43 PM]: not in the slightest Soybeenchik847 [7:44 PM]: I want to go back already jazzboyj99 [7:44 PM]: lol jazzboyj99 [7:44 PM]: why do you want to go back Soybeenchik847 [7:45 PM]: because I love that environment where I can actually decide what I want to do for myself and I love being around people who all believe the same thing I do and I want to be WARM again jazzboyj99 [7:45 PM]: did you gain anything spiritually from NCYC Soybeenchik847 [7:46 PM]: Yeah to me its real proof that what I live for is something real.
1,For some reason I have a facination with what people think of me or who people think of me as.
1,And so I'll promise you that none of this really matters.
1,So perhaps my puzzle pieces don't fit together the way I thought they had and need rearranging.
1,all I want is to be at peace at peace with my reason and my heart { Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point do look it up it might mean something to you... its french.}
1,You know for a while there I was terribly frightened.
1,hee hee I love foxtrot and there's an ad for EMU OIL on my blog... pure randomness
1,I think I want to get my hair cut like this.
1,I want to go see the Return of the King horribly so... Patience is a virtue.
1,its not what you think it is... please I begged you on my knees what more did you want you said I can't make it stop but you did eventually I haven't stopped bleeding bleeding for you my soul pouring out and draining away draining into your blue suffocating lungs sustaining life.
1,She said 'don't don't let it go to your head Boys like you are a dime a dozen Boys like you are a dime a dozen' She said 'you're a touch overrated you're a lush and I hate it but these grass stains on my knees they won't mean a thing' She says it's cold outside and she hands me a raincoat She's always worried about things like that She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault And she only sleeps when it's raining And she screams and her voice is straining She says baby It's 3 am I must be lonely When she says baby Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes Says the rain's gonna wash it away I believe it She's got a little bit of something God it's better than nothing And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to And she only sleeps when it's raining And she screams and her voice is straining She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway but outside it's stopped raining She dreams a champagne dream Strawberry surprise pink linen and white paper Lavender and cream Fields of butterflies reality escapes her She says that love is for fools who fall behind she woke in the morning she knew that her life had passed her by.
1,What if someday every thing I want is no longer what I want What if I find myself in the middle of Tibet in a buddhist monestary on assignment from National Geographic {I can't even begin to make you understand how wonderfully beautiful that sounds now} and I find that I despise the lifestyle I've taken on What if my passion ceases to be passionate What will I do now I suppose that for now all I can do is be as fervently passionate as I can... because a fire that burns higher than the trees cannot possibly be extinguished in a single moment... can it and look there's 900 hits... soon I'll have a thousand... that's kind of cool.
1,one more thing before I go to bed...{I have to get up early in the morning and go to church to practice our music for Christmas Eve.}
1,what're the bets on how long this purple/pink/girly/kinda sickening layout lasts I'm not even really in that kind of mood... it just happened... blech.
1,^this is where I spent my day today with my mom^
1,'You're the most beautiful person I know.'
1,Yellowcard--Ocean Avenue There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day staying up all night Staying up all night There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day staying up all night Staying up all night If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go it's everything I see When I sleep I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise Be together for one more night Somewhere somehow If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
1,I have decided that I hate hospitals.
1,OH and the Return of the King comes out tomorrow.
1,I'm watching My Fair Lady It's been my favorite musical since I was four or something... yes four.
1,Whoever invented finals should be shot... honestly...

1,I feel self-contained right now which is good.
1,'My mother was right when she said my father was good.
1,So maybe I'm even weirder than I thought I was.
1,I was just re-reading Walk Two Moons by Sharon Creech.
1,The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top The snow is softly fallin' The air is still within the silence of my room I hear your voice softly callin' If I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead My glass is almost empty I read again between the lines upon the page The words of love you sent me If I could know within my heart That you were lonely too I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you The fire is dying now my lamp is growing dim The shades of night are liftin' The mornin' light steals across my windowpane Where webs of snow are driftin' If I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love And to be once again with with you To be once again with with you I'm tired of dreaming about my future...
1,Hold me close Baby please Tell me anything But that youre gonna leave As I kiss this falling tear I promise you I will be here 'Til the stars fall from the sky 'Til I find a reason why And darling as the years go by 'Til theres no tears left to cry 'Til the angels close my eyes And even if were worlds apart I'll find my way back to you by heart When you go Ill stop the clock I wont ever Let this moment stop Time is stealin you from me But it can never take this memory 'Til the stars fall from the sky 'Til I find a reason why And darling as the years go by 'Til theres no tears left to cry 'Til the angels close my eyes And even if were worlds apart I'll find my way back to you by heart 'Til the stars fall from the sky 'Til I find a reason why And darling as the years go by 'Til theres no tears left to cry 'Til the angels close my eyes And even if were worlds apart I'll find my way back to you by heart how ironic it is the way things work out.
1,So I was driving home from school today by myself {Megan my carpool went home sick...
1,I don't really have anything to say and yet I'm talking{typing} anyway.
1,I'm seventeen years old and I have been to five different countries.
1,'A story is like a letter.
1,Look its Chantele and Sama and I. I'm on the left if you didn't know.
1,Ironic how this is the night I'm left without anyone to talk to.
1,She said I don't know if I've ever been good enough I'm a little bit rusty and I think my head is caving in And I don't know if I've ever been really loved By a hand that's touched me well I feel like something's Gonna give And I'm a little bit angry well This ain't over no not here not while I still need you Around You don't owe me we might change Yeah we just might feel good I wanna push you around I will I will I wanna push you down I will I will I wanna take you for granted I wanna take you for granted I will She said I don't know why you ever would lie to me Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is Gonna hurt ya And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me You couldn't stand to be near me When my face don't seem to want to shine Cuz it's a little bit dirty well Don't just stand there say nice things to me I've been cheated I've been wronged and you You don't know me I can't change I won't do anything at all I wanna push you around I will I will I wanna push you down I will I will I wanna take you for granted I wanna take you for granted I will Oh but don't bowl me over Just wait a minute well it kinda fell apart things get so Crazy crazy Don't rush this baby don't rush this baby
1,Today at church Mr. Maschler offered to let me borrow his bass guitar for a few weeks so now all we need is a drummer and Bobby and I can start a band.
1,This is how I feel right now.
1,Well this time I'm just going to let it go.
1,Damien Rice - Cannonball Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt Still a little hard to say what's going on Still a little bit of your ghost your witness Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed You step a little closer each day That I can't see what's going on Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to lie Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall When you float like a cannonball Still a little bit of your song in my ear Still a little bit of your words I long to hear You step a little closer to me So close that I can't see what's going on Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to lie Life taught me to die So it's not hard to fall When you float like a cannon Stones taught me to fly Love taught me to cry So come on courage Teach me to be shy 'Cause it's not hard to fall And I don't want to scare her It's not hard to fall And I don't wanna lose It's not hard to grow When you know that you just don't know Perhaps this is what I had intended all along.
1,This is the saddest movie I've seen in a long time.

1,My history homework: 'People make a personal connection through photographs when they look into the grey green eyes of the Afghani girl on the cover of National Geographic or when they recognize true terror in the faces of the people running from the crumbling World Trade Center.

3,Via: Mango Hi to you too honey From everyone in Network Services you just mailed this to ... (notice the '000' address you send this email to).
3,Not that we needed a graph to figure this out but this map helps show YoY gains.
3,Why the fuck did he just call what we're doing in Iraq an 'occupation' Did anyone else catch that...
3,Ever have one of those days where you set your Media Player to 'random' and let it run through your ENTIRE music selection (in my case about 1100 songs) - and for its' life it can't come up with ONE.GOOD.SONG Well that is my day and it's thoroughly pissing me off.
3,What the... Not sure that this is real but it was fwd'd to me earlier today.
3,Well not really but I went out today with my boss and a buddy from Santa Monica.
3,This from a girl I know's Xanga - apparently she's interviewing out @ Tufts and is having a tough time adjusting to Boston.
3,Well Im not going to copy the entire damn thing (It's big) but I got an email where you select your b-day from the list and it bops you down to your horoscope thing (sort of).
3,Yes even from here my long arm of power can reach you :)
3,And OMG one word for the trip: EPIC - I'll even have the scars to remember it by.
3,For those of you who didn't already know I ride a motorcycle an R6 specifically.
3,So in case anyone is wondering wtf this post is about I'm about || 1) Not piss off the moderators with my political rants which usually denigrate my witting victim 2) Direct some more traffic here - our political insult-fests (on average) get more hits/posts than anything in those sections.
3,And maybe this can help explain how furious I get when a liberal opens their stupid ass retarded mouth some choice quotes from the R6MessageNet - a motorcycle messageboard I frequent: This first one's about the Marine who recently received the Navy Cross that nobody heard about on the news: I read the citation above in the story and just wondered if the guy runs for president as a democrat in 30 years or so will the citation be questioned along with whether he really did kill as many enemy as suggested etc.
3,Expect daily changes to this thing - the one part I'm really bummed about is how 'skinny' the text portion is - however if you take a peek at the code you'll see how each 'layer' has been individually sized which means (as far as I can tell) each box needs to individually be re-sized (oof).
3,Some key excerpts from the WaPo article from earlier today: The rally lacked the star power and certainly the numbers of the first Million Mom March in 2000 when hundreds of thousands of women flooded the Mall on Mother's Day.
3,This is COMPLETELY blowing up I see no less than 15 articles on drudge referring to this crap today.
3,Firstly let me say that Michael Moore is a waste of oxygen who needs to have his breathing-privileges permanently fuckin' revoked for constantly churning-out 4-plus-hour pieces of self-indulgent garbage and allowing hoardes of mindless bastards with room-temperature IQs to call him 'visionary' and 'gifted' and all the other fuckin' mindless platitudes they reserve for only the most TALENTLESS cunts in the Director-game nowadays Michael Moore suffers from a sadly non-fatal disease called A.N.T.S (Absolutely No Talent Syndrome) and watching his movies is less stimulating than intravenous valium and almost as unpleasant as watching naked 70-year-old homosexuals fuck.
3,In today's day and age with the internet permeating our lives we are exposed to some pretty shocking shit - whether it be goatse or tubgirl or just some crazy stuff going on around the world we get it from all sides.
3,I'd posted this 'bulletin' (below) in response to one whore who just kept posting 'GO SEE F911' like 50 times a day.
3,Realizing that I just spent way to much time putting together a list of links de-bunking MM's political fiction movie released this weekend to not share it with you.
3,And why is it when you See JK on campaign stops on his right is the man he saved from drowning in Veitnam and on his left is Ted Kennedy This shit is really confusing me.
3,'We're just workin till the day we decide we've had enough' -Against Me 'Jordan's first choice' Against Me is a super-liberal punk band that I kind of put up with b/c I like their energy the guys voice is pretty cool and they make fun of liberals (they're anarchists).
3,Have to get a whole bunch of stuff done before tomorrow but: They're demo'ing walls.
3,This from our Olympic hopeful - total stud on the team turned professional maybe two and a half years ago guy about my age and our team has sponsored him through various fund raisers so he's been able to travel all around the world for various events.

3,I dont know what's better gettin laid or gettin paid I just know when I'm gettin one the other's gettin away... -Dilated Peoples 'This way' I'm at work.
3,Spent about 2 hours yesterday trying to fix the elevator in my buddy's house.
3,Sure to break both my legs my back my neck some fingers and my ear...
3,Is it just me or did these things go out of style 2 years ago If so why would two supposed 'hipsters' (my gay boss and our DJ analyst) give me a funny look when I made fun of my boss for wearing one.
3,Yes a re-post but worth it.
3,Tentatively planned for late August if not the first week in September.
3,Remember when the coups in Venezuela were 'big events' as little as a year ago Chavez (the socialist dictator) pretty much nationalized everything in the country from media companies to oil production etc.
3,I question the timing of these arrests.
3,Yes I know blogging's been light lately typical work load for a 'team' at work here is 3-5 deals just found out we have 14 in process.
3,The blast doesn't travel at the speed of light but the light from the blast does.
3,Cruising along I-5 about to hit my exit when all of a sudden I see what looks like a lady shaking her fists in anger in front of me.

3,I came to work this morning and found out one of my pc's hard drives is missing.
3,I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday and we had a really interesting conversation.
3,'People will accept your ideas much more readily if you tell them that Benjamin Franklin said it first.'
1,Hey Weekend is going pretty good so far.
1,Hey I'm sick of Xanga and Bridet told me to get a blogger.
1,This is the first post on this blog.
1,I am leaving for NJ today...going to be there for the rest of Augest.
1,Today I went to my uncle's place and then we went to the Statue or Liberty and took some pictures nad stuff...it was pretty fun although the ferry ride to the island and back didnt really go over to well i've now found out that I do get motion sickness.
1,wow so many good things have happened in the past couple of days...I got a gmail account thanks to my uncle made my gmail account my msn account ( something ive been trying to do for almost a year ).
1,My grandmother had won some free 20 min call to India thing which she wasted today by calling the wrong house...that would make me feel real stupid if that was me... Oh well she still has a free long-distance plan to anywhere in America and Canada (which I tend to be using quite frequently)
1,Today there was a 'brown party' at my aunts house and being a brown party you can expect that the 'arriving on time' concept if lost on the guests.
1,This summer i played sum ball.
1,Well after going to bed at 2AM I got my 10 hours of beauty sleep and woke up....at 12 (for all you math challenged people out there).
1,Well today (all one hour of it..) I helped Andrew's brother get a rom and emulator he wanted...It really does pay to know your way around google.
1,Wow...my second post via email...just doing this too see what all (if anything) google sends as a sig after my default... -- CHANDER
1,Wow this would be my first blog sent via email instead of using blogger.com.
1,The stupid comments finaly started working...they didnt show up till today and i posted them like how many days ago jeez But yes they have finaly started showing up today after endless hours of looking over the template code 1 .
1,One of my friends Andrew decided to go bald while I was away in NJ Jeez.
2,Can I please make it through 10 minutes of an NBA-related broadcast without hearing the word 'chippy' It's starting to reach 'there is no there there' and 'sooner rather than later' proportions.
2,So three of four gunmen within a surrounded compound manage to escape.
2,Some people were wondering why I didn't ask which company had the worst E3 instead of which platform.
2,Going to try using the new Blogger for a while.
2,Well the Canadians just finished tallying their votes a minute before I write this and what a defeat it turned out to be for Martin.
2,Seems like there's only one who happens to make 95% of the articles when they're looking for a comment about President Bush.
2,Many in the media have been telling us how wrong and downright deceitful the president and vice president have been this week for stating that there were connections between Iraq and al qaeda.
2,Man I really hate to slag off the fantastic work that Ben Goodger and Scott MacGregor have accomplished with their respective Mozilla projects Firefox and Thunderbird but what I've seen lately is disheartening.
2,Well Ronald Wilson Reagan passed away today.
2,So when the unsurprising news that 75 percent of the terrorists involved in the recent attach made the news an unnamed Saudi official claimed that it was okay because the hostages were the first priority &mdash; coulda fooled me going by the death toll &mdash; and that they knew where the others were and could get them whenever they wanted.
2,So a national security advisor to the Clinton administration who happens to be a foreign policy advisor to John Kerry stuffs classified documents and notes about them into his jacket and down his pants and leaves the National Archives with them.
2,No it's not a picture of Vietnam vets letting Senator Kerry know what they thought of his anti-war activity.
3,You just have no idea of how much I want to archieve success The reason why I am so eager to archieve success is to prove myself.
3,'Only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and I'm not sure about the former.
3,A little more than 2 years ago only NUS gave me a valuable offer without even an interview.
3,From the toppest group to the newly added group a new nh is needed to add.
3,nexthop is aodv_nhlist type data has no copy constructor for itself.
3,mt_flag_co indicates if its copath item has a key; (for non-grop member it has no key of itself) mt_flag_key indicates if its keypath item has a key.
3,So I have to make sure every messsage is received by all the receiptors.
3,this new member should be copied in the copy constructor or it will be lost during transmission.
3,When some rt_entries are to be deleted rt_seqno is set to odd and hops is set to 255.
3,I added the source node address in sendMACT parameters.
3,In MAODV sendMact is invoked after 0.5 second after sendMRQ.
3,Normally agents are connected in the scripts so that they can transmit data to each other.
3,rt_update sometimes uses multicast route sequence no.
3,The reason is no route information between neighboring nodes is recorded.
3,In the class Node it has a member struct SignalPower neighborSignal[50]; which has only 50 items.
3,But why I can use list template well I don't know just remember undefined reference error is incurred by the template
3,the method of sponsor sending key info up along the tree to the children_super needs to be optimized.
3,The method of sponsor sending key information up along the tree to the children_super needs to be optimized.
3,1. for children of super node of the sponsor or JOIN_CHILD_SUPER The first child_super nodes need to change its mt_co_id because mt_co_id should be the newly created group address.
3,Before the header of a packet p is set it is all zero.
3,Friday March 26 2004 I woke up quite late.
3,I am writing this while I am naked.
3,people are asking me who is noel's crush hmm.... who are the people who sit infront maybe it is joey say probably is it celeste or what if it is ms tejada or que horror carmela( sorry john) others tell me it is isiah ( for gender equality) or( in the second row) jun ...( south and north har har) right.
3,yes ok i didnt exactly ace the persons exam but at least i feel that i was able to salvage some crucial points.
3,last night i was stuck in traffic for two hours.
3,curses i mean ok i didnt do as well with my freaking statcon subject.
3,legal writing is normally bad writing.
3,the exam yesterday was quite a surprise.
3,today is our day of reckoning.
3,Adriene I love your essays and I could easily relate to most of your experiencesespecially those that have hints of angst.
1,So i knew from the start i should get my own blog just for me just as Dave said.

3,it's one of quotations that i got from our daily bread.. (not a name of bakery shop ).. when i read that quotations.. i was speechless.. it's not just a sentence.. but the meaning of the sentence really comforts me.. i am not too religious though.. i almost attend every sunday service.. i even join 2 choirs in my church.. (heh) but still.. so each time i have problem or so many problems i always try so hard to remember that sentence.. somehow.. it works.. that sentence can strengthen me.. i know god works in any way that can't be understandable.. or so unpredictable for us -a human being- but i know he'll always there for me.. not only for reminding me of the good... but to carry me.. in my devastated time... p.s: i think 'my good side' is all around me when i write this heheheeheheheee....

1,I'm all alone in my house tonight...
1,This is my first post of what will hopefully be many.
2,I should be asleep but I am not...instead I am up just thinking about the past present and wondering what the future will hold.
2,Concerned for the Future By Sandy Escobedo January 10 2004 1:19am New York NY As I sit here and read through endless articles on Latino experiences coming particularly from those who are from LA I can’t help but wonder how “Latino” are my kids going to be I ask myself this because I am presently coping with the confusion one encounters when your passport reads “U.S.
2,Life in the NYC certainly has taken its toll on me.
2,I am in my graduate class right now and I am having a hard time trying to seem at least half interested.
1,The start of the day wasnt so bad i woke up at 12:05 watched tv for a while then went outside to mow the grass with my mom but as u know in my family when everything is going good somthing bad is about to happen and it did.
1,Today a Sunday will probably be the most busiest day for my parents because they have a retarded baptisms to go to which I think is absurd because they will not even be the godparent What the hell.
1,Today was quiet despite my mom ruining my tranquillity by waking me up to help her get some groceries which really pissed me off.my brother came by today to come eat Bar b que whick my mom made because my dad cant cook for shit.
1,Today at practice I felt really good and I think I have improved far more than I expected.
1,Everyone of my family members are out working or at school learning new things but me im just chillin here talking to some friends on the internet.
1,Its been a while since ive wrote a new entry in my blog but im finally back.
1,It was one of the best weekends I've ever had.
1,It's so late but i'm talking to friends who have all these problems with some girls so instead of listening to that bullshit i've decided to type this post.
1,In the midst of a good day i recive a letter in the mail informing me that i've been cut from the high school baseball team due to missing the entire offsesson which really pissed my coach off.
1,Man this summer has been so awesome and long.
1,Today at cross country practice i was really scared because one of my friends who i was throwing rocks said i broke a car windshield.
1,Somtimes i wonder if...... the person i am going to be destined with looks at the moon while i am.
1,This weekend was by far the coolest and most relaxing but as u all know my life does not always stay that relaxin all the time.
3,My lovely and fabulous Tivo recorded the E True Hollywood Story of Diff'rent Strokes.
3,I love the summer before the Olympics because all of the fun sports events are on Screw football and basketball Baseball is a fun event to attend during the summer- but I am talking about Wimbledon every summer and lovely gymnastics swimming and diving trials up until the August wonderfulness that is the Olympics.
3,I know it is Tuesday but I am finally telling about my weekend.
3,So I thought I would be good at the blog stuff because I love telling lots of random stories.
3,So I am totally freaked out by this whole blogging thing- I don't know what to say Zuhair helped nothing by being completely obnoxious about what I had already written Thanks a lot Zuhair I am using this opportunity to tell you to go back to where you came from (This is a joke other readers if there are any Minorities can bond like this and no one likes his kind anyway anymore they are so last decade).
3,If you are reading this you might wonder why part of the title is 'the misadventures' (I take it if you know me you know why it is called Action Jackson).
3,So I am trying this whole blog thing out...I don't know if I will be very good at it.
3,This new show Amish in the City is my new favorite reality show I am officially addicted.
3,Okay y'all- my project for the last few weeks was to figure out my finances.
3,I felt the need to have a hit counter on my blog because I can kind of tell if people are checking it out or if I am just talking to myself.
3,I have decided to start a new reason for posting on my blog- my mom and her random thoughts.
3,Well I will have everyone (or the two people who read this) know that I am CPR trained.
3,I added this Blog on my website where people can write about their break-ups.
3,So one of my good friends has left the lovely environs of LA.
3,Did anyone see the Wedding show yesterday on ABC I think For all my Wellesley friends do y'all remember Christine(a) Hrul I remember chrul from the message boards- anyway she was on this show because she randomly decided to marry her HLS boy in Prague in a castle.
3,Well the weekend held quite a few surprises for my friend shermain from the sherm and I.
3,So I heard that The Village was extremely dissapointing- if anyone out there in Blog world has seen it let me know.
3,I was driving around running some errands and a Creed song came on I think it is called 'Higher' - I know I know insert collective groan here...at first I was laughing and joking around that Creed was over- they are kinda freaks at least Scott Stapp- but hey if someone with a ridiculous Jesus-complex wants to take me higher where blind men see...then hey why not Deep thoughts by (Action) Jack(son) Handy....
2,Well I have so much to say and so little time in which to say it.
3,Do you rely on a 'good gut reaction' or that 'special feeling' when interviewing perspective employees Are you confident that your new hires will be successful Are you good at interviewing prospective employees When I talk with executives and ask if they are good at selecting successful employees they often indicate they have (or have not) been lucky lately.
3,Some employers seem to go out of their way to lose the best employees they have.
3,Yesterday I was quite clear about my life and where I was heading had put the lid on my previous relationship and was set to move forward.
3,Today for the first time in my life...I created my own blog ...my little diary which will be the one thing I want to maintain ...so as to fill my thoughts..and pour my heart out to So ...here's to being my companion thro my life...my little black book

3,Today was on tragic day in my life....finally the curtains had to draw a close on this show and the next show had to take over.
3,This is something I had on my Website..and has made a huge impact in quite a few of my friends lives..coz they used this to decide whether or not they were in love...
3,Last night was a major pain for me the weather was too good and I thought I would be a pleasant night for me.

3,My blog could never be complete without this all time favourite song of mine... the intoxication power of Love I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand I dream of fire Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire And in the flames Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire This desert rose Each of her veils a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this And as she turns This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams This fire burnsI realize that nothing's as it seems I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand I dream of rain I lift my gaze to empty skies aboveI close my eyes This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand Sweet desert rose Each of her veils a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this Sweet desert rose This memory of Eden haunts us all This desert flower This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of the love

3,For a long time while watching serials like B&B Santa Barabara Dynasty Young and restlessNeighbours etc I used to wonder when the reference used to be made about your 'First true love' Everytime it used to be picturized as this feeling which was unmatchable and something which could never die from your life I used to wonder hey its' just a person who comes into your life and then moves away and you then move to the next person...so whats the big fuss all about But then a few days ago I began to take a different angle to this ideology and decided to do a little research on why it is said that ' true love is the purest form of love and why one cant ever get over it for life ' First and foremost when does a person fall in love the first time Well one can hardly say coz true love is quite different from a crush or an infactuation it's this feeling of weightlessness which overtakes a person and makes them feel that the entire world in which they exist is too perfect when in reality they know quite well that it's far from being called perfect When one falls in love for the first time the emotions which conquer the heart and mind are quite unimaginable really everything feels amazing there is a complete halo aroud the person and things feel absolutely perfectly warm and romantic When does this happen to people well can happen at the age of 10 50 or even 80...one never knows when they'll find that first person for whom they will have such overwhelming feelings for....it just happens one fine day Everyone remembers their first love.
3,Now this one topic which has always got my attention since I am just the type of person who is quite uncomfortable with the thought of making a commitment to someone whom I dont know well enough.
3,Was reading this interesting article online and kindly did a little bit of analysis on where I could have gone wrong in this..and try to rectify next time around... How prevalent is office romance I did an unscientific survey among my colleagues and discovered not only had they had at least one office romance some of them met their spouses at work.
3,All these days I have been wondering about my relationships how I went about each of them and what went wrong in each of them.
3,This was an article which I had read a few weeks ago....thought it kindof makes sense to me....actually lot more sense to me now... 'A person is limited only by the thoughts that he chooses.'
3,Yesterday I had to run thro a series of test was a major pain simply hate giving blood and running myself thro' tests.
3,The day so far as been an interesting composition of unexpected stuff and expected stuff.
3,This weekend probably was interesting in a different sense when compared to my last weekend.
3,This morning as I was doing my yoga I suddenly got this really interesting idea for a book or movie.

1,You're The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S.
1,'But the demons of the past were demons of fire and abomination...they were enemies we could fight-enemeies who inspired fear.
1,My heart is hurting beyond words The pain is tearing up my soul These days have seen my spirit die My life propelled out of control My wounds lie naked to the world My depth of suffering exposed This damaged past can never heal Until this nightmare book is closed.
1,Remember I will still be here As long as you hold me in your memory Remember when your dreams have ended Time can be transcended Just remember me I am the one star that keeps burning so brightly It is the last light to fade into the rising sun I'm with you Whenever you tell My story For I am all I've done I am that one voice in the cold wind That whispers And if you listen you'll hear me call across the sky As long as I still can reach out and touch you Then I will never die Remember I'll never leave you If you will only Remember me Remember me Remember... me...
1,It begins very small Seems like nothing much at all Just a germ just a speck just a grain But the seed has been sown And before you know it's grown It has spread through your life like a stain And its power will strangle your love and your joy And its hunger consumes for it lives to destroy Hate is a star; it becomes who you are Not the hated but the hater has a torment that's greater It will eat you alive consume you and spit you out Hate's gonna win that there's no doubt about Hate doesn't care who you are- Hate is the Star Learning hate is an art even people who are smart can be caught can be crushed can be creamed Hate has swallowed you whole Did you think you're in control Hate you though hate you spoke hate you dreamed All your hate gave me substance your lives are undone It's your eve of destruction your hatred has won How could it come to pass This awful twist of fate How could I hurt you This madness can't be so I can't believe it I never dreamed that any barriers could rise Or that I'd ever see the stranger in your eyes Our hearts were hurting both the same The hurt was tearing up our souls The fury in us made us blind We could not see beyond the pain Ares---
1,Now it's time I fear to tell I've been holding it back so long But something strange deep inside of me is happening I feel unlike I've ever felt And it's makin' me scared That I may not be what I think I am What of us what do I say Are we both from a different world Cos every breath that I take I breathe it for you And I'm so afraid.
1,Both sides of isolation and freedom Halt and hide in my heart Eyes close as the sky depends on the Strength and weakness of a single god while the breast of the knife shines True feelings show through the mask I put on my head Absolutely the difference seems Absolutely this night by myself only within myself More and more at a distance More and more I'm the only one who goes to the end of the sky to escape Anxiousness and wishes mix to oppose my destiny The angels and devils individually whisper inside my head Without compromise today and also tomorrow can make a difference Absolutely the difference seems Absolutely not only are the soul and eternity the same More and more its sweltering Absolutely this night by myself only within myself Arigato Ken

1,I'm done with the School for this year.
1,For now on I will post in english so all the world get's my message.
1,Well I have opened a discussion on the s-linux forum about .NET mono and stuff.
1,I'm working on a graphical tool for adding/removing users from a mysql database.
1,Finally I have my own Linux server.
1,Today I played a little with gtkmm.
3,It has been a week since the passing of President Ronald Regan.
3,On the advice of author Hugh Hewitt I’m starting this BLOG.
3,Ok get this I call Apple and the laptop is back in action.
3,I'm off to Chicago this weekend to lend a hand to Jared as work continues on the new Chemlab record.
3,Focused (read: the boring process of burning cd's) at the moment on the next aggression EP for THESE MILLION NIGHTS which by the way is my all time favorite aggression song.
3,My former neighbor John Cale has a new EP out called '5 Tracks' which I believe is a precursor to a full length album due out early next year.
3,Acumen brought the pain to NYC and the way I am feeling this morning the pain has been brought.
3,Back from another trip to LA...saw Saintface last night at their biggest gig to date at the Mercury Lounge.
3,Still out of it from the Chicago trip.
3,Almost 3am here in Chicago...tired beat exhausted and all things like that.
3,A brief hypefactor update: I spent the past two days writing choruses and tracking guitars for two hype songs although I cannot tell you which ones because I haven't a clue about song titles yet.
3,All you have to do is read my previous Cerati review and apply it to last night here in NYC with a few noted changes: 1.
3,Lots of catching up today... Chemlab is in the home stretch.
3,Back home at last...But I would like to vent against Apple and their hardware for a moment.
3,It’s no secret that I have a tendency to exaggerate a bit hence the origin of the name Hypefactor (though that’s for another time).
3,As an addendum to my comrade Matt's post about Saintface via the American Heritage Dictionary... wan·der·lust n. A very strong or irresistible impulse to travel.
3,One of the common denominators among the members of the MOGpac is that we are drawn to new music by performers who have been at the game for the better part of twenty years.
3,I'm burning new Chem-Mixes now again.
3,Unfortunately Raw at the Staples Center didn’t happen last night but after a Looooong weekend at the San Diego Comic Con I need all the rest I can get.
3,My 'lovely underage girlfriend' and I were the sole MOGpackers to represent the most recent Saintface show on Saturday day night.
3,I waited a few days before posting this but the other night my lawyer/agent/advisor and I ventured to an obscure part of California called Costa Mesa to see the reunited original 5-piece Duran Duran in what was supposed to be their first US show in 18 years (unfortunately they threw in a club gig in LA the night before thus making this the SECOND gig in the US in 18 years).
3,Guess what Today I was invited to come play on my solo record.
3,The Chemlab artwork continues to shape up into something very special.
3,Well the guest stars SHINED last night even though Ash forced us to record in the dark.
3,Hypefactor day 3: Reviewed B's guitar work since the last session.
3,Jamie Duffy calls tonight to discuss Chemlab.
3,This recent trend of exclusivity among game producers is REALLY beginning to irk me.
3,In between the new Hypefactor sessions (and until the new aggression remixes come in) my musical attention turns to Chemlab.
3,The first round of Hypefactor guest stars have been contacted and have agreed to pop into the studio this week to bring their unique stylings to the table.
3,Day 2 of the new Hypefactor sessions were again productive and successful.
3,Since yesterday was Day 1 for the new Hypefactor material I've decided to keep an ongoing journal about this record so a year from now I can look back and see what this album eventually started as and how much it either changed or stayed on course.
3,Spent the bulk of the working on two things: 1.
3,We ventured to Brooklyn last night to check out the Sigur Ros/Bjork show.
3,As of 5 p.m. today - Saturday - there are enough guitars on 'Solar' to injure a small animal.
3,I had chosen not to post about last nights session as I felt Brandt captured it almost perfectly.
3,F.J. Ash and I had an extremely productive evening in the studio yesterday and all four or five hours of the session were dedicated to the recently-unearthed 'Solar.'
3,Brandt is a young douche who is paying $300 to see Duran Duran.
3,As you will probably note F.J. beat me on my last post by about 10 minutes.
3,For weeks if not the entirety of the hypefactor sessions thus far F.J. repeatedly insisted that he recorded a moody piano part for a song dubbed 'Exist' one of four or so that are quite well-developed at this point.
3,Dropped into the studio last night.
3,En route back to NY finally.
3,Saw Year of the Rabbit again with S.O.
3,I spent the bulk of Tuesday knocking another song into shape.
3,Taking the streak even further I cruised into the studio on Sunday to check on progress there.
3,During my recent West Coast jaunt I couldn't get focused on the HF2 material mostly because the Chemlab mixes were rolling in and it was hard to switch gears.
3,After seeing a really good film called DIRTY PRETTY THINGS starring Audrey 'My eyes are bigger than your head' Tataou the S.O.
3,Little B has the flu so the studio is basically contaminated.
3,Early AM call at the studio yesterday for us to review Robin's guitar parts from earlier in the week and alter NEW SONG to fit those parts accordingly.
3,With Ash unable to make it last night the spotlight focused on Ms. Emmet who while brought in initially to be the aggression’s first and only drummer (and quickly became my favorite member of the aggression) has become quite the impressive guitar player in Hypefactor.
3,I'm saddened to read reports that 16 Volt have called it a day.
3,Quick Pit Stop in the studio yesterday for some bass overdubs and retracking some older parts to fit the current scheme of things.
3,Booted out of MOGworld for a girls night I made my way to the cage last night to review our work with Link as well as address the outstanding needs for the album as it stands.
3,From an E-mail from Peter Saintface yesterday when seeing if he wanted to hang out: 'Hey F Afraid I have a SF recording session slated...looks like this EP is actually becoming an LP' About time.
3,Former MOG founder and aggression superstar Mr. Link came to town sax in hand and though we had a short amount of time with him it was very productive.
3,The Factor Corporation gathered it's division heads at the cage last night.
3,While the asses cobraed yesterday it was back to the Birdcage (the new name for the studio) to work on the Audio Warfare remix.
3,Regarding a collaboration between Duran Duran and Gwen Stefani Guitarist Andy Taylor said: ''It also has to work musically.
3,Took a brief pit stop into the studio last night for a few hours to fix up Solar.
3,Back again from another Saintface gig last night this time an early show at Mercury Lounge.
3,Hello again everyone (all nine of you.)
3,LA's been a whirlwind of early morning and late evenings.
3,So Mr. G and I reunited to see KILL BILL yesterday.
3,In the wake of the recent rythmn section shake ups in Ass Cobra which I'm sure is going to lead to some nasty shit amongst the MOGpac Ash and Robin made their return to the Birdcage last night.
3,Hi Ashley: After an early breakfast this morning with my old pal the famous Martial Arts Cinema historian/Author (who hated KILL BILL by the way) I decided to stroll through Times Square in search of inspiration for my mom's Birthday gift.
3,Despite my being distracted by Dan Hamill's discovery of classic wrestling on channel 70 the vision of the new Hypefactor album became significantly clearer with a whirlwind editing/arranging sessions yesterday at the Birdcage.
3,In DC for a few days.
3,Last night at a hotel in lower Manhattan I met the man who influenced me to pick up a bass guitar when I FIRST met him 12 years ago.
3,I write this with a headache a mile wide so bear with me.
3,The Face made their Knitting Factory Debut last night for an early show opening for someone called My Favorite (who have a bit of a following I'm told).
3,I am going to be in some deep shit with this... Jackie Chan in talks with government to construct a Jackie Chan village in Hong Kong over the next ten years by Wu Chi Ming 2003.11.17 Jackie Chan took interviews with a few Japanese newspapers the other day and revealed plans to cooperate with the Hong Kong government to construct a village (the Jackie village) in ten years time.
3,Out of touch but a little bit of time so here I am...
3,For the first time in weeks I made it down to the studio to get back to work on HF2.
3,There's a lot of HF going down right now actually.
3,Well Saintface finally had what they claim will be their last gig of 2003 (I'll believe THAT in 2 days) and it was a true test for the band in that they were plagued (and I mean PLAGUED) by technical difficulties that reminded me of the aggression's 2001 comeback gig in NYC.
3,This comes all the way from our new friend Timo who lives in Berlin who I mentioned a few posts back about having trouble getting our CD's.
3,Sorry its been so long but thats not to say there isnt anything exciting going on.
3,Been spending some time hanging out with Irene at home and working on loops for Jared's new project which I think he would describe as 'broken word'.
3,Vocal demos continued through the weekend with the heat at the studio going in and out at will.
3,'As of last fall I am no longer writing music with nor working in the studio with Ministry.
3,With a big sigh of relief I re-entered the birdcage yesterday to get back to work on HF2.
3,I'm back in NY after a whirlwind week of LA and San Fran.
3,I have to admit I have been musically unproductive as of late.
3,I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out what my musical BEST OF is for 2003.
3,Ok so no drums were actually recorded on sunday.
3,Saw South on Friday night who were very enjoyable enthusiastic and technically awesome.
3,At last: The Star Wars Trilogy on DVD February 10 2004 The most requested films for the DVD format will finally become a reality this September as Lucasfilm Ltd. and Twentieth Century Fox present the eagerly-awaited Star Wars Trilogy for the ultimate home entertainment format.
3,Just when I think I'm too jaded and that I've seen or heard everything this planet has to offer me i read this and I become that 17 year old at the Marquee again: From the New Order website worldinmotion.net 'Good morning Peter what is going on Hooky's world today PH: Spending lot of time recording New Order new album and at the same time writing songs for my new side project with Mani and Andy Rourke.
3,Reeling from the Indy debacle (and I know quite a bit about it what the hell went down with that) Irene and I cabbed it to her fave hipster hang Piano's to check out some Saintface.
3,What a shity way to start the day.
3,The elements had to smack somebody sometime so thanks to a fever of 103 Brandt had to bow out of Saturday's drum recording which effectively killed that.
3,So Irene and I made the trek to a midtown Manhattan movie theatre to see a special preview of HELLBOY the large motion picture based on the Dark Horse Comic.
3,While I don't have anything specific to report I will just jot down my thoughts today: 1.
3,so there we were the douche the superstar and the recently legalized girlfriend at Citizenfest '04.
3,Well I'm still coming down from the Wrestlemania experience.
3,Last night the Factor Corp. gathered for the first time in ages for the next round of drum tracking for HF2.
3,Sorry it has been some time since I posted last but an attempted graduation and HF2 have swamped me for the past few months.
3,This warm and sunny morning started off with a chance run in on the corner of 17th and Park Avenue with the wonderful Robin who as I learned in this brief time spent with her is quite 'busy and jangly'.
3,My Significant Other a fine woman ventured via Chinatown bus (the in thing to do and extremely cheap) to DC to check out Neubauten.
3,Again it what seems like a decade the main Factor principles of Brandt Ash Robin and myself gathered for the first official HF photo session.
3,The weather suddenly gets good and things get going here First off my laptop is back and to make a long story short when upgrading to OSX something went wrong and I wiped out EVERYTHING I have ever done in this laptop.
3,Things post-laptop problems are starting to get back to normal a little bit.
3,It's been an incredibly stressful week thanks to my totally screwing up my laptop while trying to upgrade my powerbook to OSx.
3,A friend of mine once said that beer is the force that gives us peeing.
3,After more months of drum sessions in Garden City than I care to remember the Factor Corp. - sans Robin who was deservedly cavorting with her boyfriend - met at Birdcage for a meeting/listening session covering the drum recordings and edits thus far.
3,First things first thanks to the Quizmo website I have created 'Test Your MOGness' quiz for the members of the MOGpac.
3,So while arranging the song B Ash Robin and Charles wrote DESCRIPTIVE we paused to eat some Great Wall and watch the Season Finale of 24 which was really good.
3,I admit I was supposed to write this post days ago but I am back to editing drums for Exit Strategies and keeping everyone up to date went on the backburner for a few days.
3,Just back from the Harry Potter premiere here in NYC.
3,This might be my first blog from the air.
3,With FJ loitering outside all-male theaters on Santa Monica boulevard and sharing iPod tips with law enforcement news on the home front is my responsibility for another week.
3,I can only assume I am blogging so much because I am on a plane in the morning but just to tease you the Hypefactor Live Experience just took an interesting twist.
3,From today's NME comes this years most awesome event: NOEL GALLAGHER and IAN BROWN have collaborated on a track for the former STONE ROSES vocalist's new album.
3,Though this blog is usually reserved for the musical portion of my life I must report today that I am a victim of false reporting on the internet.
3,Upon finishing the post below something was nagging at me.
3,Been running around like mad man as I get ready for another LA trip so bear with me if I seem if I can coin my dentists description of my agent/manager/lawyer: Scattered.
3,An extremely productive time was had at the Birdcage today as we came closer to wrapping up all the guitar overdubs.
3,Jesus where do I begin Last night and at long last Irene and I made the trek to Harlem to the legendary Apollo Theatre to see Morrissey take to the stage for the first time here in many years.
3,It's a lazy day in MOGworld as Irene has been downed by a mediocre 2am cheeseburger that didn't agree with her (damn you Gramercy) and I'm just flat out beat.
3,I'm still digging the Ryan Adams album immensely to the point where it's taking me time to get focused on the new Cure album.
3,I'd like to take a quick moment to announce the arrival of the newest little member of the MOGpac...Lucia Mary Magdalene Link born June 24 2004 12:36 a.m. 7 pounds 8 ounces and 52 centimeters.
3,A whirlwind of a day ended at 3am last night and after a long day of the au bon pain studio chinese food fixing my fonts more studio Pluck U Saintface many drinks soical time with the ladies of Internationalpoontang.com a near barfight a guy in a thong (yes he was the near barfight) a very public threesome (yes this involved the guy in the thong) and some pizza I feel we all earned the right to sleep in this morning... We were able to find Leo somewhere in NYC yesterday and after a fun breakfast catching up we dragged his ass into the Birdcage and put him to work.
3,I'm leaving shortly to go to the studio to work with B and our special guest Leo V23 who is in town for a spell and has been roped into to add even more to this album (hopefully in the form of some sharp backing vocals).
3,Matt is obviously poopy from the lack of aggression in his life so let me tell you about the Skinny Puppy shows.
3,I keep talking about how we are in the home stretch and while these songs are pretty much up to snuff and just need drum edits before mixing one song called one.nine.five.six (which I'll herein refer to as 1956) has plagued us.
3,Between an evening at the movies and a night in the studio Thursday was a good day in MOGworld.
3,Well after months of anticipation Irene and I were finally able to stay in town long enough to join MOG Athletics' Dodgeball Team for their second tournament.
3,Well hipsters I'm looking forward to seeing you at the Cure's travelling festival next month and if you see me there you can thank Mattagement because thanks to a Ticketmaster screw up the Internet Pre-Sale didn't start as scheduled and computer glitches made it EXTREMELY difficult for Dan Hamill and I to obtain our tickets this morning.
3,Obviously he's been too busy staring at the birds across the way as Brandt in his genius totally skipped over our Memorial Day session at the studio which was in fact the First Official Vocal Session (tm) of the album.
3,For the second post in a row the MOGpac heads south of the border.
3,If you weren't at Rothko's on Friday night you missed it meng.
3,There is literally never a moment of rest this month as I woke up at 4am got on a 7am plane flew to NY walked in the door kissed Irene hello ate some Pluck and then ran off to see Saintface in Brooklyn at my favourite venue Southpaw.
3,My nephew Cameron J. Bradish informs me that we must never EVER talk to the Mondu which is a korean dumpling that Irene's mom makes that is blow away the best dumpling I have ever had.
3,My LA trip is taking its toll but it does allow me a few fun moments.
3,The con was THIS close to a full success mostly because I got screwed big time out of the convention only Batman figure.
3,The Rollercoaster I am on called ComicCon continues to run me ragged.
3,Despite not being here for a few months California is just how I left it: Sunny hot and filled with the usual suspects.
3,Since all is quiet due to MOGtravel let me throw in a quick note about the Prince show I attended on Monday 7/12.
3,Well the above phrase was uttered by MOGpac Athletics team captain Matt after the Pac lost a crucial dodgeball match to the tournaments first ever (at least from what I've seen) All-Girl team and I think that sums up last nights D-ball performance.
3,First off I just love the above title which is a quote from a description of the new Jackie Chan movie NEW POLICE STORY.
3,Starting with this post I will start a new section of this blog entitled 'What I've Learned From...' in which when I feel I have learned something for better or for worse from someone.
3,Beat from what seems like a week of non stop insanity I will try to recollect the past few days to the best of my abilities.
3,Here is today's fan mail send to my hypefactor.com address: 'Rarely have I read through such a vast pile of horse manure.'
3,i'm not a fan of europe.
3,While I cannot write volumes about the KMFDM debate as I am on holiday in Praha and writing this on the clock in a 'net cafe I will say this in response to FJ's query... Sascha's comments about the making of Money are quite accurate although some of what he said in the aforementioned interview was news even to me.
3,In response to my previous post the person I called out on the H-bar board regarding KMFDM's MONEY album has responded and with factual back-up to boot.
3,A few things on my mind while I have your attention: On a late night visit to a magazine store on 3rd Ave I noticed that some 'rock' magazine called REVOLVER had not only an article on Ministry but also some kind of 'definitive' history of industrial music in.
3,The days draw near before Irene and I head to the other part of the world so the chaos is at double speed (even though I am taking the time to blog and she is on the couch watching a screener of TROY and I think slowly regretting it).
3,Taking a break from music (and having a sick girlfriend at home) I caught up on my movies while also checking out several TV pilots that you all will be watching in the Fall.
3,Sadly with a girlfriend with flu-like symptoms my planned screening of COLLATERAL didn't happen.
3,Still without any time to really take a day to rest Irene and I joined by G Lurch and Ash (who graciously provided transport) went out to the landfill known as Randall's Island to check out The Cure's CURIOSA festival.

1,tired...and grouchy...and feeling bad and apparently I am getting nailed...for sentence fragments.
1,My mentor sent me an email...which I thought was worth sharing There are so many things I wanted to say while reading your letter that it actually got me out of bed again- FIrst Its critical that you remain open-minded not let your prejudices cloud your viewpoint..especially since you have so little real exposure to other cultures in situ.. you make a number of comments very derogatory to western civilization (corrupted fake commercial) that reveals your distaste and bias against it...So before I get too far into this tell me if there is any evidence any argument possible that would dispel that belief (not that I particularly want to)- If not then you are holding your views as a religious person in which facts and rationality take a back seat to prior learning indoctrination and negative emotions.
1,I just got another email from Gordon.

1,Ok so i got dropped on my head this time..sucks..but i am still alive The girl..hmmm... well..she is not strong enough to put me in a full so half of my body is in a full and the other in a pre...yeah ok..duh..I am going to fall....but we finally hit is so I was happy Anyways more important then that I was the first one finished when we ran today...I added more weight to everything today...so I am really happy about that But my jumps still kinda suck...gain muscle takes a way from flexabilty so i seriously need to strech..and i need to learn the Fight Song...i feel so lost when we do that...and i hate yelling...I guess i am not 100% cheerleader Now i am sore as all hell....
1,So i am doing this whole meeting new people thing adn ti is kinda akward..I dunno how everything is going to go...I am glad to get a move on with my life....there is so much that I didn't know about life becuase i was stuck with one boy...maybe stuck is not the right word.. becuase i did love this boy...but i was only able to see life through the eyes of a person in love...no that that was so bad just diffrent you know...I get to experience the fullness of life...ya know i am going to beleive that in all thing there is a purpose...so this boy needing his time must be for a reason....maybe he was holding me back....ha ha...which is funny...i dunno..o well....babysitting...and hoping to find a genuine person out there some where...not a boy driven by his little head...if you get my drift...well here is to the luck of a new life...waiting to be comfortable
1,Well this i think over rules the drama in my life...the boys trying to break me heart and the girls trying to ruin everything i have worked for...My gradpa has heart faliure...and basically there is nothing he can do but to sit and wait to die.
1,ok so now i know he likes her and i think that it set my lil heart free....so here is and add for me.....Jessica is a wonderful smart highly emotional girl..searching a stable loving muscular handsome smart rich(or not but preferably so) guy Ha ha Well San Diego helped out a lot..time way...freedom...I got sun burned... but it is turning into a tan So the single life is supposed to be more fun anyway...rihgt girls Well at least i am happy now right Well till the next drama occurs....good luck wishes
1,no idea where to start...broken heart is a fact Ok so i ask the world this question is it love or the brain that moves people If I am so logical...it should be logical that i am a dumb girl..who needs no boys...they fuck everything up... HArd time i have been in much harder tiems but wiht the same boy and i wonder will it ever get old.
1,I wish i could be a movie star..broken heart...take a trip across the world...ha ha I am so confused at this moment in time...someone help Bring me a cute nice boy.. who cares And someone kill all the bitches hores and skanks...they polute the world...Damn Well who knows maybe i will find myself a nice person in San Diego.
1,For breakfast i had a left over pancake form last night...yummm I got a call which i can't really determine if it is going to turn out to be something good or bad...i guess the rest of the day will have to pan out before I make any assumtions.
1,ok first off this 'blog' is called in cursive because i used to have a book i wrote potery and stuff in and one day my best friend Karen noticed when i really felt deeply about my subject/topic I wrote in cursive...so that is that moving along.
7,OK sorry for abandoning all of you out there wondering hOWL in the hell I'm going to work nights when: a. I don't really want to work nights.
7,OK what is time shifting It is the key to transition from the world of the day walkers to the night life and back again.

Why does everything have to do about money.. if you aint got money.. well you cant do shit Isnt that fucked up.. what happened to the days that you could be entertained without money UH oh well i guess thats life.. Fucked up and out to take every down to the shithole oh what joy well i dont know what the fuck to say so Im out
1,Man I really don't know what hurts more liking someone and cant having them or trying to let go.
1,To think that I finally found a person who seems to understand where I am coming from can be so many miles away and only now I have found them.
1,well... thanks to a new found friend.. not really new to me.. but I'm finally gettin to know a little about him... i am startin my own journal 'blog' thing.
1,why cant you see.. the deeper side of me.. why cant you see.. that all my poems arent about past lust.. past relationships.. why cant you see that there is some who see this person i am.. these people.. i dont hold close.. when im in my skin.. because they are in theres too.. there skin and mine.. dont really click.. they wouldnt go together.. 2 drummers.. a fighter.. theyve taken the time.. to know me.. all of you.. know the skin.. and what i write.. pain.. and the love.. and what im scared of.. they know.. they relate.. they are naked here.. naked with me.. opened up.... and those who read this with all the deeper side.. dont smile with the last lines.. of nakedness.. but yet.. the skin they are in.. does smile.. the child side.. the people we create... but we.. we are diffeent.. we are one of kind.. we all express ourselves.. we all have a time to open and a time to close.. so you who cant see.. see the deeper me.. see whats really there.. then youve lost the touch.. youve lost yourself.. you are no longer a one of a kind.. you have become what society wants.. you have followed the footsteps of others.. but us we mark our own path.. we are the people you cant see
1,if love was all you had and you think you've lost it what do you have left nothing.. nothing.
1,i cried today i've lost my way please find me here alone i need you here to guide the way to hold my hand at night to keep me warm to keep me safe to show me to the light the darkness here the things i fear enclosing me in tight your face i see your touch i feel have helped me through it all with you right here the fear has cleared please never lose the sight to see me here with all this fear alone through all the night
1,i use to like aboy with blonde haor and blue eyes he seemed to be the perfect one but those were all just lies then you came along and swept me off my feet i couldn't help but smile as my heart skipped a beat the feelings for that boy started to erase everytime i talked to you and got to see your face you have a different vibe then that other boy everywhere you walk you bring happiness and joy your laugh is like a love song written in the air i like the time we're together and the moments that we share i wish i was brave to tell you how i feel but i cant help but wonder if this is real then i see your face again and i know its true all these feelings that i'm having are all because of you
1,how did we end up like this so far apart so distinct i feel like i dont even know you you were my soul mate my everything but now you've become just another voice on the line you're not mine i dont claim you its over cant you see we made it happen once before but now im done no longer do i want you i dont crave your kisses your touch because im finally done cant you see the new me the woman i've become im in search for something new something far from you someone who doesnt know me He'll get to know me deeper then you ever did then you ever tried this is my new voice stronger wiser ive learned from you but now i'm done your my past the person on the other line the person who i'm not afraid no more butterflies no more
1,do you hear it the voices from the past spoken softly in the night i hear it as the cool wind blows i hear it with a creeping chill running down my back the voices of wise the voices of old filling my head and dreams they know so much of life and death the answers to all questions all i hear is gentle whispers not to make out a word i hear it as the night is still i hear it when my eyes are closed just concentrate and stand still to make out the voice that takes me to a different world my lullaby for sleep do you hear it the voices from the past spoken softly in the night
1,lets not speak about it ever agin lets not go down that road of what we are and come to be and how it started out every beginning must have an end the cruelty of life death to us is not an option its what we'll come to face we will meet it young or old some to be too soon some with pain and some without but always alone no one to help you no one to explain what is to become a heaven paradise is what we think the pretty thoughts we made nothing is empty nothing is sad something we've never felt life is something we never have nothing until the day we die our final thoughts as breath grows slow as the heart will take its stop do you see a light or total darkness night do you see the face of god what is there for you if only these answers i could know this process wouldnt be so hard the fear of death the fear of end nothingness at all
1,What lies behind behind those lies this wall let me find you save you are you scared the real you is there behind it all does anyone know him the guy behind you

1,What Happened To Us by Hoobastank Album : The Reason I thought it was too good to be true I found somebody who understands me Someone who would help me to get through And fill an emptiness I had inside me But you kept inside and I just denied Some things that we should have both said I knew it was too good to be true Cause I'm the only one who understands me What happened to us We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only Remember they thought we were too young To really know what it takes to make it But we had survived off what we have done So we could show them all that they're mistaken But who could have known The lies that would grow Until we could see right through them Remember they knew we were too young We still don't know what it takes to make it What happened to us We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only one We could've made it work We could've found a way We should've done our best to see another day But we kept it all inside until it was too late And now we're both alone The consequence we pay for throwing it all away For throwing it all away What happened to us We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only What happened to us What happened to us What happened to us What happened to us

3,colourful displays of affection beaming with the happiness of a smile to be envied by others.
3,I want to hide away tonight with you climb into the darkness into the warmth beside you I want to hide my face from the world and feel the warmth in the dark places beside you into our cave away from everything else away from the world I want to climb into the warmth of saftey into the darkness will you come with me my love will you hide with me and hold my hand will you pet my hair and whisper giggles the warmth is so inviting beside you I feel safe with my eyes closed.
3,such a smile takes away all worry how strong hands can cup and hold so gently my face a gentle kiss melts the world away making this depression slip aside into the light some days are so horrible I know the pain that lurks within me and how it creeps taunting me with the loss of you filling me with fear that you may leave you help me fight.
3,...pulling my leash with urgency until my face is so close I can smell his scent everywhere.
3,beyond the call of gods and of heroes beyond that taste of salt on lips i feel the infinite wonder i taste what gods feel within their caves of plato what majesty is within these walls feeling the stone never to be toppled the eyes never to close out the light the infinity of darkness within these strong barriers protecting soft hands and delicate sensations from damage the will of Her that allows passage from one to another to another and then to end resolution.
3,seductive secretness behind doors warning me to never let in the silence warm air inviting sleep and quiet reflection wind moving and creating the noises that silence me strong arm protecting me from the nightmares that envelop my mind in the darkness his body warms me while his eyes consume me blessed be this place of saftey and serenity I am at peace at last with him that holds me at night.
3,For being so kind to me when I need you most; for holding my hand and petting my hair when I cry; when you bring me water and chocolate icecream; when you offer cuddles without saying a word.
3,blurry outside sounds as people mingle and pass in the darkness focus on hazel eyes filled with wonder and ... searching lips moving; mind's attention soaked with longing the background melts away bodies moving closer without moving touching without intent feeling the warmth of another's breath the past fades away I have found my heart within him I know the meaning of desire at last.
3,my body feels broken while my mind rejoices at the thought of you the warmth of a smile dulls the pain in my legs the promise of an embrace erases the sight of another hill sweaty bodies mingle in the dark warm places of the mind sleep envelopes me safe within your arms to be awoken with a slight kiss
3,transported through the air into the mall across town through the throngs of girls in pants too low and boys with gold necklaces into the shop beside the bank near the bathrooms the colour of love is present not being over-powered by the sound of elevator music and rap mixed together
3,life that has over-come the garden taking control with vibrant chaos and green-ery burnt by the sun again cut by a blade drowned again by the flood to be trampled by a foot and hand again bless-ed sweet water washing away the dirt and grime again
3,White that blankets has turned grey Quiet of the evening danger promises slick noise to be hated trudging trudging trudging sludge sludge sludge in an office building I hate with people I pity instead of the white forest quiet reflection nature instead of consumer drive shallow endeavores win over thin ice and frosted trees the spring is coming the holly king is dead the oak is reborn again i mourn the holly prince as She celebrates the rebirth both celebrations are lost on those who worship here i pity myself for my presence
3,The fire that forms The rain that cools The air that shapes delicate fleshy hand touching history cold and eternal history of persons animals the Earth the gods feeling the power within and sharing knowledge of one another leaving a part to take a part that will be shared again something small and light within my pocket; cupped within my hand; held between my fingers; thrown out into the ocean.
3,that moment comes so quickly seeing all that is to be understood I see the possibilities you help me see the present we make the outcome visable to others and myself.
3,Mighty fury drowning out the sounds of death creating life through destruction a pity that they do not understand those who cannot hear Your song whispered in the trees flowing through the river death is not punishment from Your touch but a promise of new life.
3,the strength of the sun is warming my back welcome great king sit upon Your great thrown in anticipation of the end.
3,the fury comes in bursts into the mind the eyes see the possibilty of revenge against ... torture through seeming kindness works here hours wasted but not in vain self-glory hands dirtied in the striving of perfect retaliation the rewards are sweet to the taste and eyes the ears are rewarded with praise and the pride with stiffled fury of the victim the sweetness is better then any hot meal

1,Somebody tell me Why I can't react to thoughts of separation To thoughts of death Thoughts of suicide No fear or hate A mental dusk falling Falling So many feet per second So many at once Somebody explain Why when I get close to the Grand Canyon And look over the edge Or stand on a highway shoulder and squint As a thousand suns glare past me Why do I have the urge The inside urge The unexplainable insatiable curiosity To jump Trip fall Into the earth scar or onto the asphalt Just to see what would happen Maybe I am dreaming more than my mind Enjoys now I haven't dreamt in my sleep They're making up in waking Wandering In a half-stupor Wondering which way to turn Looking from a tower upon literally Thousands of lives Striding about in self-assurance I want to fall Feel the wind pulling at my ears Though I could never plunge from High diving board Low diving board Fear of height to an extent But fear is what kept the early man alive I think I can't feel it for what matters Or maybe I don't think Maybe it's all an instinct Someone tell me Am I the only one who has These irrational fits of mood Even though No no one no psychiatrist Ever diagnosed me Perhaps its a mental disease no one Found It's been almost a day since I had a cheerful idea No nightmare No dream Just dreary reality That sucks the imagination from Everything Don't hate me Don't pity me I just want an answer Life is like insulin Hate it but can't do without it Take what you got Even if you never wanted it Somebody tell me Who I am And am I now

2,For those of you who are wondering why Bill Gates would stop at Illinois before traveling on to Carnegie-Mellon MIT Cornell and Harvard here are a few reasons why he came here (and why you should come here too): -Microsoft hires more employees from Illinois than from any other university -Tim French goes to school at Illinois -Illinois is a fun word to pronounce -orange and blue are great school colors (if you're not colorblind) -did I mention that Tim French goes to Illinois -there is a low Icelandic population so moms are safe from young men here -bowl cuts are available here -mullets are NOT available here (sorry Adam and Steffen) Alright so while the first reason is probably the only reason Bill Gates came here you should all consider a visit to the Illinois prairie.

2,hey baba wht in the world was that...do expect us to read that whole shitcoz i dont think u wud hav read it urself.
2,Ahem errr...emotions are not abstract its subjective...u knw wht emotions u have towards a person..it changes with time and circumstances..(just like abstract class in JAVA) not believing in abstract metaphysical theory indicates that the person has sound logical and sense of questioning things and not go by flimsy theories which do not have a sound logical base... All of us knw that the 'truth is out there'..so y jump the gun ...we knw just 5%..we knw that we dnt knw anther 10%..wht we dnt knw is that we dnt knw abt the stuff we dnt knw is 85% ;)...
2,Critics are well wishers in disguise Hey Hash everything meta begins from something abstract...coz even emotions are abstract Few run away from what they feel is true coz they want to believe it otherwise and hoodwink themselves.But truth is something like an air packet under a water body...itz gonna come up and burst your bubble.
2,well some words of advice for Diablo and BABA ..man u guys talk so meta physical ..its so hysterically rubbish ... its more like u guys talking on a topic like 'PHYSICS OF SCIENCE' even though its crazy u can just bluff abt it and make it sound sensible ..LOL hehehe ..dnt take it personally Assi can be a good writer..he shldnt waste his talent..
2,......A PORTAL is created for everyone to commune & share their vibes...alas mortals are always tied to a materialistic bondage....commitments & expectations pull them apart from what they are destined to commit & act....for itz only after death they realize their chance has slipped...& all they have got is eternity to atone their sins....do remember life is brief but after death lies the real test
2,just for smiles Hey guys Please give due credit to Mr Rao he has this to say regarding a blog post about microsft.
2,U know Diablo every person has a aura (I mean the one that is seen around the head of great people) Now only children see this aura and when u grow up will not be able to see it.
2,Life is indeed a funny musical chair competition....the music keeps ringing in your ears ripping your tender ear membranes....for a fewLady Luck smiles & they get a seat...others keep running in the dark...banging their heads..bruising their bodies..wrecking their confidences...they just keep running hoping that the music is going to stop the next instant Alas mortals are blessed only with that...HOPE -Diablo-
2,Hi people Hw u guys doing i wanted to knw who is Diablo aka Dreamer_80 A couple of things.
2,Babies find my face funny.. Every time I get the privilege to go coochie coo a small baby am the one who gets butterflies in my stomach soon as I get into the scope of his/her vision....There is a half baked burp & a sudden gumless smile do find babies cuteadorable & yes extremely huggable.Adorable is fine with me...But why do they laugh when they see my face Most of my pals say its actually a gift to make someone laughbut babies..Its hard to digest for me.Maybe they are a more intelligent class than what they subtly portray might say it reflects on my insecurity or whatever...But its not a particular baby...Its the whole clan.

2,Since my return from England in July more than a few of my tastes have changed.
2,...after a long day of playing Final Fantasy X-2 chatting with friends on AIM and going through adventure-gaming websites and an idea occurred to me as I pondered about making my own adventure game: why not make a Harry Potter adventure Okay so it's not really original but what irks me about the official Harry Potter games published by Electronic Arts is that a) they are painfully mediocre and b) they utilize only a tiny fraction of the possible gameplay elements offered by the Harry Potter universe.
2,...of many entries about gaming one part of the eclectic hobbies in which I spend my free time (which is all the time at the moment.
2,My blog is now searchable via the Google code at the bottom of the main page.

4,........................................ do I have big stories inside ........................................ Here’s how I feel today: (is this a danger of public journaling Feeling out loud in public Especially when a sentence is modified with the word “today”) I feel like a reasonably disciplined and moderately talented writer who doesn’t have any stories to tell.
4,................... post it notes ................... have you seen the thing where people cover an office door or a cubicle in post it notes -- that say something or make a design with color is there a verb form for that kind of minor office terrorism like t.p.ing with toilet paper when lynn was a high school english teacher one night one of her favorite classes celebrated the end of a unit on Romeo and Juliet by plastic forking the pages of the play across our entire lawn in the middle of the night.
4,............................. shocking hypothesis ............................. haven't been blogging because: 1. front burner just firing up (beginning of a new semester) and 2. i really like my front burners right now -- job particularly... and it makes me think that blogging last semester was a low cost quickie form of escapism from the feeling that i wasn't quite so fond of my front burner.

'girls can't be presidents only boys.'

3,Well it was Brents going away bash this past weekend It was great fun The padres kicked in for food and beer...they got not only 1 keg of the glorious C- but 2 It was awesome And you would think that 2 kegs would be too much but not for this group of partiers We pretty much finished both I couldn't believe it And I have to say that Jay and I kicked ass at Beirut We were the first team to take Brent and Matt to sudden death overtime O' yeah baby We didn't quite get the big W but we gave them a run for their money The night came to a close with of course.....the hot tub Its amazing how we always end up in th hot tub at 3 in the morning and why we think that is normal I don't know LOL The next morning we were all feeling pretty chipper.

3,Well E3 is over and it was awesome.
3,Ok so I have checked out the Redondo police report and the Beach Reporter crime watch report and no such arrest of an irate man that was rear-ended and arrested on Saturday May 8.....This is not complete proof that it did not happen.....But I am smelling a big hunk of bullshit If Cory can actually find an arrest record I might be convinced but otherwise the smell continues to permeate
3,All I have to say is that I HATE Windows XP My employer (and IT department whom I've spoken with about 30 times over the past 3 days) for some reason thinks that this 'operating platform' is God's gift or something.

3,2004 has begun and this promises to be a year of many many changes for me.
3,So I'm on probation at work.
3,Last night my celly rang and rang and rang.
3,Today was another snow day The thing about snow days is that they start off great because you experience that initial excitement of knowing you're going to get away with staying at home doing nothing all day.
3,Last night was fun but it brought with it realization that I am almost 25.
3,My computer and internet connection have been down for the last 2 days.

3,Never ever ever take 4 children under the age of 5 to a theme park when they've had a full night sleep and you've only had 4 hours sleep .
3,Now please note the above title must be said in a certain way.
3,Even though the weather this summer has been essentially shitty.
2,Well not exactly 2 years 51 weeks I know.
2,I've had this blog for only a week now and I'm already slacking with my posts.
2,Recently I came across a mix CD that somehow got thrown in a box of my desk stuff.
2,So as I said in one of my posts before I am a first time home owner.
2,I ended the previous post thinking I was going to run some errands and then come back to finish later.
2,So my first attempt to link to something failed.
2,I'm not quite sure how this whole weblog thing works so bear with me.
2,I think I jinxed myself when I made the comment about getting better about posting more often.
2,I'm getting good at this posting every other day thing.

2,It took me almost five days to get motivated enough to post my thoughts about ending my first week of exams.
2,Is that what everyone does after taking their first law school exam I would like to think so since that is certainly how I felt yesterday.
2,We received an email a few days ago from one of the deans here on campus.
2,You would think that with my first final exam week approaching so very rapidly I would have lots and lots of things about which I'd be motivated to write.
2,What on earth is going on with my counter Last week I checked (yes even though I didn't post...shame on me) and the counter said around 1100 hits.

2,i guess i should retire for the night... i have been apathetic enuff for today
2,well...work has calmed down... ...back to idling on IRC
2,btw when your ISP tells you to check your email settings to make sure you're not using email servers from 3 years ago because that server is being shut down you FUCKING DO IT
2,my god ppl are so fucking stupid....
2,hmm...work looks like it may be hell today
2,hmm...just remember today would be my dad's birthday...i should prolly call him...but i prolly wont wake up today till its time for work...
2,so early in the morning...i really should be sleeping....or reading comics (i've got quite the stack to catch up on)...or watching anime (i've got gigs worth i should be watching)....
2,going to school 5 days a week is horrible...
2,it's been awhile....life is still pretty sucky...and school starts in just a lil over a day now...
2,what the hell are you staring at
2,well i am registered for classes but they dont have my loan up on financial aid yet so i can't confirm registration fin.
2,i really need to register for classes...
2,what the fuck is wrong with me
2,most people would probably say my problem is in typical male bravado: 'i need to get laid'
2,i find i'm happiest through loving another...when i'm allowed to show someone how much i love them and make them happy then i am truly happy...
2,What do I do to ignore them behind me Do I follow my instincts blindly Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening Do I sit here and try to stand it Or do I try to catch them red-handed Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin I make the right moves but I'm lost within I put on my daily fa�ade but then I just end up getting hurt again By myself (Myself)
2,well...it didn't quite hit 1250...but i dont really care
2,40 words down only 1210 to go
2,i dunno if it's just taking them or taking them again after a time of not...but my anti-depressants cause me to wake with horrible migraines
2,hmmm...i really should be going to class...
2,it's amazing what anti-depressants do to your outlook on life after not taking them for like 2 or 3 weeks...
2,'I CAN'T LOOK AROUND it's too much to take in I CAN'T HOLD ON when i'm stretched so thin I CAN'T SLOW DOWN watching everything spin I CAN'T LOOK PAST it's starting over again'
2,i can't fucking do anything right...
2,everyday i'm beginning to face death at my own hands more and more... and sometimes...i yearn for it...
2,cleaning up a lil..moving the archive to the bottom and renaming it 'previous'...also added links to the #A-G and #AiA forums
2,and i didnt make it to my doctor's appt...the one i prolly wouldve tried to change treatment to bi-polar...i should probably reschedule that
2,im beginning to question if i even want to continue japanese...i started out because it was something that interested me and it still does...but i dunno...complications in my life... i used to be the top of my class in almost everything an overall scholar...and now now i fail everything i drop out i miss classes...drugs alchohol no...just mental illness depression...mental illness has destroyed me...'so seek treatment'...i have i am it helps...not enuff anymore...'so seek a different treatment'...and what 2-3 weeks of hell in between as i adjust to new medication perhaps it for the best... how did i do so good my first semester at ETSU i had 12 hours...a good MWF 10:30-2:30 schedule...September i was married...October i was told she wanted to leave me...November she moved out...December i passed all my finals...an overall B iirc... second semester i had one early class on Monday and i failed it because i could never make it to it...i failed US History because i just quit going... this semester i tried to even my classes out to all 5 days...US History on TR i dropped because i was up to 9 absences in like 4 weeks...English on MWF i dropped a cpl weeks later...i didnt drop Theatre on TR and have since already missed my 10 days...Japanese is all i have left and im getting ever so close to 10 absences there as well...i havent done my homework in weeks...
2,57 days 21 hours 46 minutes and 40 seconds left until the premiere date of Nemesis
2,Gundam SEED 2 released in IRC...not as horrible as the first release...that was a mess...this is somewhat controllable...
2,only 3 days of work this week... only 2 days of class... surely i can make it through that... doctor's appointment on Thursday... then away for the weekend...or so the plan goes... i dunno...i can already see myself lying awake...in silence...
2,the 10/15 7pm post never went through before because of Blogger problems...as you can see im still alive =\
2,it is settled...i am making my preparations...i am sick of this life
2,i have come to realize the cycle of my dependency... i meet a girl...i get to know her...i need her to live...she becomes my everything...i want to die when i lose her...i hold knives to my wrists...i give up on trying to kill myself...times passes...i meet a girl...
2,WHO THE FUCK DID I PISS OFF TO DESERVE TODAY'S DAY OF WORK HUH WHAT KIND OF DEITY WOULD DO THAT TO A PERSON
2,j3 is beginning to believe his depression to be more-so bipolar or manic-depressive...im 2 absences from failing ENGL-2010 so i will prolly try to late withdraw from that class...
2,IRC calmed down... personal life is still a mess...so lonely...
2,i dont go to class... IRC is pissing me off... sigh
2,long time no see....im still fucking neuro...let's see...i hardly go to most of my classes...on the verge of failing all of them...the money i got for a laptop i've been wasting on a sound system and PS2 and various other crap....English's 2nd essay is coming up and i don't even know what the fucking assignment is...ive missed 6 of those classes already...4 more and i fail it....got a japanese test tommorow that should be fun...and im a week behind in homework for that one....ah well....i did FINALLY get my finaid check to come thru...just got to go pick up my balance of aid check... my personal life is great...i want a social life...but i dont have the time...and if i did i wouldnt use it to socialize...i dont do the the social thing...maybe i just want a small group...maybe just one other person...but then ive been saying that forever on this page havent i ...anyway...im done...go away....
2,guess i need to talk to sensee about still taking next semester (2020) despite this...and then making up 2010 this summer so that i can still complete the minor...if not this summer i may be taking next year's (3015) and 2010 next fall...
2,and im at 9 now....1 more and i fail....1 more and its all over...no more school....no more friends....nothing but work... IRC has been just great recently...i found out half the channel thinks i am in command the other says otherwise...tonite's meeting is supposed to cover among other topics 'leadership'...
2,45 days 6 hours 57 minutes and 39 seconds left until the premiere date of Nemesis
2,7...i have 7 absences so far in Japanese.... i got my replacement insurance cards so i should schedule dr. appt soon yey for pirating Sony Playstation 2...
2,i can't say it...but i'm sure i feel it...the words just sound wrong tho how could i what do i even know of it besides too many times i've been hurt...you dont get use to rejection either...
2,i dont see why so many people hated Nemesis...i loved it caught the 12:01 showing last week...
2,i dun think im gonna register for classes... im gonna have to retake JAPA-2010 again next year anyway...and noone is really gonna be in 3rd year i know i guess....so taking 2nd year next year....and i dunno if id even go to campus for other classes this semester if im not taking japanese...i kinda need something i actually LIKE to keep my interest....funny that when things were the worst at home i did best at school...now im just fucking lonely and cant do anything in school.....oy
2,just a dream....but in that instance it felt so real...and so right...but it was just a dream... still it leaves me curious as to her being now i hope she's happy wherever she is...
2,hmmm....90% of my paycheck gone before i see it...DAMN BILLS
2,of course im -$54 in the bank
2,well... $26 is close enuff to $20
2,yey less than $20 this coming week at comic store...
2,damn i want one of them new Powerbooks...maybe not the new 17' but atleast the superdrive equipped...
2,weeeee....Transformers Gundam then Bond now G.I.
2,you know that feeling when your eyes are heaviest and you know you're about to fall asleep any minute i've been feeling that for hours before actually falling asleep now...and then i wake up 1-2 hours later and repeat...
2,dreams again... and dreams where earlier parts of dreams were just dreams...
2,if i put the time it took me to take the IQ test into the form rather than leaving it blank and letting it assume the full 13 minutes my IQ jumps to 149
2,It is a far far better thing that I do than I have ever done; it is a far far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
2,feh... this IQ test said i'm only 138 i defend my low score with the fact that i was talking to complete idiots on the phone while taking it...
2,jeebus christ im at work at 8am on a monday...god this sucks
2,yeh i think i'm over it all now... back to just my computer and toys and comics...
2,did i mention it was raining
2,is it a sign of weakness to walk in the door and fall down in the middle of your bedroom floor and just start crying
2,let's be honest here... the whole thing would be like 'hey remember me i'm that little kid you wanted abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with'
2,i also looked up the last name in people.yahoo.com and had it draw a map...
2,hmm... you haven't locked me up yet... what if i tell you i honestly believe she liked me best but was just afraid of a relationship at the time is that enuff to sound crazy yet
2,okay maybe i'm very obsessed... to be spending all my free thoughts on someone i haven't seen in years... that's just plain committable... lock me up and throw away the key
2,i'm a bit obsessed...you know i still know her old license plate number =\
2,hmmm...maybe if i take my pill i won't be so pissed off at every little trivial thing
2,thoughts of her my hating myself all of these are just phases...and all of them pass...everything in my life is just a phase...and they all end
2,'...you are afraid of losing someone dear to you.'
2,messing around with the template...adding links added the counter from digits.com
2,also on the topic of dreams...had a bit of lucid earlier today right after work...i realized it was a dream when i started losing my teeth again...that happens so often in my dreams...not rotting or anything just like when a tooth comes loose when you're a child but i usually lose 2 or 3 or more in a dream...of which i've read in some meanings could be: '...you are afraid of losing someone dear to you.'
2,about the dream...while it had the usual 'this is a dream so everything is fucked up' aspects...it had me desperately vying for her attention...that part was pretty damn accurate
2,it is fitting that last nite i dreamt of her again...
2,Valentine's is a day only to piss off the single...
2,my updates as of late have been...lacking...to say the least
2,well not so much thinking more-so obsessing...
2,there was another dream... but i guess really it was just a cameo appearance
2,'It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something more It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone' -chorus Linkin Park - Easier to Run
2,'I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make sense I say what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do Face away and pretend that I'm not But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got' -verse 2 Linkin Park - Faint
2,how do i know that you're all not just figments of my imagination that i'm the only one that's real because i'm just not that damn creative...the comics i read the books the tv shows i watch the movies the games i play the people i know i could never come up with all of them just to create a world around me...
2,i like to escape reality... my imagination... and always the hero... tho sometimes a villian... but always the chivalrous one... protecting someone =\
2,i give myself one more month... then it'll be time to end this failed experiment called life...
2,i remember the dream... it was different because it was confrontational... and this page was involved too... but i actually stood up how unlike real life...
2,i can't decide... and what's worse even if i do decide to i constantly fail to act upon any decisions...
2,and what do i think of the whole Iraq thing well i've heard good points on both sides of the military action argument...
2,another dream... this one was a little different but i can't for the life of me remember it now...
2,it was a stupid idea anyway...
2,alright... getting off of work at 9:30... w00... maybe go out and get some dinner with my girl... catch a movie or something... oh... wait... =(
2,i don't even know how to approach or if i even should...
2,off and on for almost 10 years now...
2,why do i awaken early every day why am i not getting enough sleep
2,and if i had the chance what would i say haven't i said it all before to her even multiple times before over the course of several years...
2,it's not worth it... none of this is... the romantic in me wants to run away... the realist wants to die...
2,i know i know my poetry is contrived... trite... derivative...
2,'I didn't get to be with you Now you're stuck in my mind' Saliva - Bleed for Me off the Daredevil Soundtrack
2,i'm beginning to believe the dreams are someone up there having fun with me there's no point to me having such but someone up there knows it drives me insane...
2,i don't know which hurts more... the mistakes that i make... or the chances i don't take...
2,it has been awhile since the last... another dream
2,all i want is a chance with a love i've never known a love that's never left my heart no matter how far we are apart all i want is to know her for her to know i care to hold her in my arms to protect her from all harm but all that i am still just a little boy full of fear full of emotion afraid of what he'll be if just given a chance all i want is a cure to help clean up my life to cure the loneliness to clean up this mess all i want is an end a simple fucking end to this misery and strife to this simply fucked up life but all that i am still just a little boy full of fear full of emotion afraid of what he'll be if just given a chance - a chance
2,i guess when i'm not whining i don't have anything to say...
2,now there's an idea... probably a bad one at that though
2,the following was a look back at other times written now about times before as evidenced i've always been like this... the first part paints a picture for you the latter explains what the picture does to me and how in the end its all i can do to hope to forever battle against myself for this...
2,golden locks exquisite eyes a smile that makes men kill shapely form mentally keen and an elating intonation euphoria takes control and forever i am lost like so many others who came before victim to mine own lust a turbulent battle ensues hormones emotion and wit and all three lose and even yet all three seemingly win what power latches onto me what evil do i grapple a prisoner to my own accords i cannot even fight time and time again the cycle forever endures and to have it any other way i wouldn't even dare - '03 untitled 1
2,what is this all about an empty bed in an empty house and i don't mean sex... i mean falling asleep in another's arms... another falling asleep in mine own...
2,this whole page this is what i do to the people i love...i go on and on with this...how can i put another through this am i that selfish
2,weeeee... i take daily vitamin now... it chewable
2,maybe i am just a hopeless romantic... or maybe just hopeless
2,pathetically obsessed over a girl who probably wouldn't even give me the time of day... hating my job more and more... IRC has become contrived channel politics are enough to make anyone want to die or atleast leave...
2,my friends have real problems and here i am nagging about juvenile fantasies...
2,the funny part is i haven't taken my anti-depressants in a couple of weeks... and i feel fine... then again it could be because i'm so distracted... but if i can be distracted is it really a chemical imbalance induced depression or is just me being a wretched soul crying for attention hmm...
2,and you ask me what irony 'Hope all your dreams come true Love (name withheld)' that irony...
2,i found myself driving by that old house... empty now...
2,even my job is telling me to just fucking die already...
2,and the one person who could actually help me get in touch with her or at the very least let me know how she's been i don't even broach the subject with...
2,i haven't even spoken to her in a year and yet she's all i can think of now...god what's wrong with me...
2,i was pretty sure from the picture that i had found it but when i zoomed in on the map on expedia and saw the name of the road in front of it i knew that was it...sigh
2,Daredevil was suprisingly damn good... the soundtrack fowns too...
2,god i feel sick... i let the bad man of #a-g win... i quit the channel... and something this stupid is tearing me apart...
2,i want to see her... but i know how it will go i know these dreams just torture me i know they will shatter i know i will fall... and right now in my life i have no one to run to when they break... perhaps i should go back on my medication... perhaps i should let the dreams go...
2,another dream... my god it felt so perfect
2,god the cruelty of this torture...it's been far too long...
2,apparently one of my ISP's nameservers takes forever to update because if i nslookup through it it still points to namezero while the other is up to date... also it seems the dreams have returned...
2,i could solve most of my problems if i just put a box up and hosted on that...but argh...
2,yey looks the blog will have to forward unmasked/uncloaked because i don't get a title and meta tags for each forward just one damn title for all subdomains... sigh also all the whois and everything show the new location but my ISP's DNS is still pointing to the old... =\
2,today will be fun comics tho...lots of money...Transformers: Generation 1 Volume 2: War & Peace...there's like 8 covers
2,dealing with registrars...fun and the dreams returned last nite...
2,it's about time i get up off my lazy ass and do something...
2,i just read 3 Daredevil TPB's written by Brian Michael Bendis; Wake Up (DD Vol.
2,oops it was my understanding that i get a $30 credit towards an amazon purchase but it turns out instead they're gonna give me a $30 gift certificate code on my first monthly statement...whoops...oh well...ill just find something else to buy then...the oops is i just bought this other stuff and am forever putting myself into debt... i'll prolly just use this card like John plans to use it to pay online purchases (for the Amazon points) then just pay it immediately thus getting the points and keeping the balance at $0 then again i just xfred $200 from my other VISA to it so that's a cpl months just to get that back to $0... oops...
2,yeh i said that last night to try and trigger one... and it worked too...
2,it's been awhile since the last dream perhaps they've stopped...
2,You are Morpheus from 'The Matrix.'
2,i can't go on like this...
2,even now i can feel the tears starting...
2,i don't know if it's sweet or just plain creepy... i drive around town and can remember things from 5 years ago from 9 years ago...
2,and then there's the realist in me... i know it would never work i haven't even seen her in years... or spoken in over a year... if she's changed i don't even know her anymore... if she hasn't changed well did i ever really know her then there's the question that really irks me why why would i choose to fixate myself on her... is she the proverbial 'one that got away' is that why i'm doing this or is it something more like a chemical inbalance that i'm choosing not to treat...
2,what i felt was true before has been ripped from me... time and time again i have something good and it never lasts... and yet i choose to live in the past... remembering the people i loved and remembering the pain they caused me... hoping that i can perhaps change things that what i felt was still true despite their denials...
2,i believe there are two sides to me... the hopeless romantic and the cynical bastard... i believe there are more things in this earth than we can understand and i believe in destiny... but i also believe in choice... how can there be destiny and choice wouldn't who we are control our choices and yet each choice would redefine who we are... i want to believe dreams have meaning our actions are with reason... i dunno anymore...
2,that and because of my stupid insurance i still owe my doctor's office $55
2,well all i need to be elligible to receive financial aid again is a note from my doctor that verifies that i'm being treated and that he 'thinks i'm ready to return to school'... that might be a problem though with my inability to ever make my doctor's appointments...
2,turns out my package wasn't stolen but it wasn't delivered either...Amazon and UPS is having problems in this area as i've been told by my coworker that he recently had an item returned to Amazon for having the wrong address even though a second box that was the same order came through just fine... supposedly my book should be delivered monday =\
2,i need to see her... despite the pain it will cause... perhaps the hurting will end this whole dream thing...
2,well it seems i had a package stolen from my front porch today within 10 minutes of it being delivered...
2,but don't you feel betrayed no... not really...
2,i should give up... just give it all up
2,what the hell am i thinking...
2,each night i die from dreams of blue and gold
2,I'm addicted to stress that's the way that I get things done If I'm not under pressure then I sleep too long And I hang around like a bum And I think I'm going nowhere and that makes me nervous Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright Everybody's thinking about me.
2,or it doesnt... it does make it hard to get up the next day tho...but that could be because im trying to get away with only a few hours of sleep...
2,my Wolverine broke a claw so he's being sent back for a replacement
2,okay... 100mg of 5-HTP a night does weird shit to j3
2,alright 1-10 let's run down the summer movies so far as rated by me... X2: 9 or 10 Matrix Reloaded 7 or 8 (will go up prolly when i can watch Revlotions right after it) Hulk: 6 or 7 T3: 8 LXG: 5 Pirates: 6 or 7 Tomb Raider: 5 or 6
2,is anyone else sick of the redundance of these
2,hand holding - you like to be in constant physical contact with your special someone but you don't want to take things too quickly.
2,noone ever says they miss me noone ever says let's get together noone ever says they think of me noone ever says ANYTHING to me... and you people wonder why i feel so f-ing alone...
2,hmph i had some clearly non-Vash answers i guess the Vash still won out tho... LAABBU ANDO PIIIIIIIIIIIISU LAABBU ANDO PIIIIIIIIIIIISU (love and peace)
2,I am Vash the Stampede the Humanoid Typhoon I am a hunter of peace chasing the mayfly known as love.
2,saw T3 a few nights ago... it's sometimes failed attempts at humor not withstanding it was a great movie that still manages to capture the Terminator feel... and despite the lack of one James Cameron it's still a great follow-up that manages to revitalize the franchise... and oh yeh EVERYONE DIES
2,another dream where i'm being ignored... maybe i should take the hint...
2,this city is run by idiots... fireworks at 5:45am so the dogs next door start barking too... i had just lied down for bed... so that made it a little hard to fall asleep but i finally did... then comes 11:00am the fucking parade and all the fucking sirens and dogs barking because of the sirens...so i get back to bed at noon...
2,what's my 2 cents well life sucks... sometimes it sucks more for other people sometimes more for yourself... our 'God' likes to play sick jokes on us... makes me feel guilty for not being able to help and for even thinking my life sucks when it pales in comparison... and it makes me feel bad that i don't even know what to say about it... that's what i think =\
2,I just don't know what to do with myself I don't know what to do with myself planning everything for two doing everything with you and now that we're through I just don't know what to do I just don't know what to do with myself I don't know what to do with myself movies only make me sad parties make me feel as bad 'cause I'm not with you I just don't know what to do like a summer rose needs the sun and rain I need your sweet love to beat love away well I don't know what to do with myself just don't know what to do with myself planning everything for two doing everything with you and now that we're through I just don't know what to do like a summer rose needs the sun and rain I need your sweet love to beat love away I just don't know what to do with myself just don't know what to do with myself just don't know what to do with myself I don't know what to do with myself The White Stripes - I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself
2,i wonder what brought on the dream this time... the migraine last night the repeated listening to Dennis Leary - Asshole or the on-again/off-again thunderstorms we've been having or maybe a little bit of all or none cus it's just a dream get over it... asshole...
2,there's really no excuse you all should be ashamed
2,i just don't know what to do... i'm trying to find a part-time job (in place of my abscence of school) something like opening retail or something... but i realized i really have no 'references' anymore... also trying to fill out an application for a different job (would involve me quitting XTN) but i have no idea what i'm even supposed to put for the desired position on it...
2,it's times like this i wish i really had the strength to take my own life... i mean it's not just the money... if not for jenn in the first place i'd prolly still be living next door in the back of the house... i can almost guarantee that in 20 years i'll still be right here in this house all alone in some dead-end job (possibly even the same dead-end job)... i tried school even tried socializing there neither went all that great... now all i do is work and come home and work and home work home work home... i've complained about it for some time now over and over again i guess i should've added that to the repetition (work home bitch work home whine work home moan work home complain etc)
2,the bank just tried to cash a check for 2.99 and it went negative then another...so im also currently $47 in the hole just because i ordered 2 'free' G.I.Joe action figures
2,there's nothing wrong with pacing around the house worried about nothing in particular but feeling very worried nevertheless... right
2,let's seeeeeee.... Star Trek: Enterprise 's 'new direction' is kinda eh... i like the idea of Archer roughing people up cus they whole crew is pissed off but the blatant and unbelievable sexing up is meh... atleast give reason to it... Once Upon a Time in Mexico was pretty good... BANG BANG the Conan O'Brien 10th anniversary special was great... haha o.O O.o what nothing else... go away...
2,i realized the other day i quit thinking about her everyday... of course that means i now do again... way to go idiot...

4,what an end to my week.
4,for some reason today was my angry day.
4,Today was the first time I experienced a hot day in San Francisco.
4,and thus begins my attempt to journal all that is not exciting.
4,i think i ate too much.
4,and so another week goes by and I realize that I still don't have a routine down.
4,Apparently my new hobby is completely over scheduling myself in my free time.
4,My last official day of unemployment wasn't a complete bust with thanks to some of my friends.
4,what a week... once again overbooked and crazy but that's better than over worked and crazy so sign me up for another week.
4,The thieves knew what they wanted I like to picture them with a list in hand something written neatly in cursive on a 'from the desk of...' notepad: Things to get from old Saturn today ~ catalytic converter pipe muffler rear bumper interior center panel various and random parts of air filter battery cover air filter cover manual pennies covered in spilled soda map of San Francisco and an anti theft club.
4,Last night Alex and I had a blast First we had a little visit to the Emeryville police station and then took an exciting trip down memory lane by stopping off at the Richmond police station.
4,Last night I got home (after a smooth ride in the Grand Prix) to find that I had no cable.
4,it's been awhile and although I could write about a lot of things that have happened in the past 2 weeks I would much rather whine about my car being stolen.
4,In my ambition to be more domestically creative I attempted to make a peanut butter chocolate pie Sunday night.
4,I've been struggling with insomnia lately and sadly I turn to my fine friend - TV (accompanied by cheap cable) for comfort.
4,Things finally feel like they are starting to turn around for me.
4,Is it wrong to like being behind the wheel of an SUV Is it bad to feel empowered for having a height advantage I'm feeling guilty for my new found love of bigger cars.
4,Because I thought that yesterday was going to be the last day with the Grand Prix (which I think I may have grown to like) I figured I should end it on an ironic note and decided to listen to the Smiths on the way into work.
4,and as it turns out our haunted house kicked some serious ass.
4,In the grand scale of the cosmos I'm not really sure what this means... but I feel that it's worth mentioning.
4,Christmas time is always a little hectic when I try to finish up those final details at the last minute everything else in my life seems to fall to pieces.
4,I can't remember when I last went to a Toys R Us (I just hate giving my money to a big crappy toy store like that...) and if I had remembered how visually assaulting it was I probably would have not set foot in one again.
4,I ended up making three of those chocolate peanut butter pies... they were a hit and somehow they got renamed 'crack pie'.
4,Last night I spent some quality time on the couch watching some seriously crappy TV.
4,I just went into the lunch room here at work to get some gum and the television was on.
4,The dude who delivers our paper put a Christmas card with a self addressed envelope in our paper about a week before Christmas.
4,I'm not sure what normal people do over a long weekend but Alex and I fill it up with all sorts of pajama lounging usually some furniture gets moved around and occasionally some impulse buying takes place on that magical 3rd day.
4,Insomnia is a terrible waste of my time... if I could only find a way to make it work to my advantage it's not like I can start to vacuum or do a sink full of dished between the hours of 1 and 5am.
4,On Wednesday night I went out with Wil; it was back to the scene of the crime... Martuni's.
4,It's been awhile... almost a month... since I've written.
4,I get to wear jeans to work everyday which I think is pretty rad but right now my three pairs are in a sad state.
4,I started my day with a healthy sized panic attack so my head would hurt just right for an hour flight and an all day outing at a beach (scouting a location).
4,Stress from my job is setting in the insomnia caused by the stress is catching up with me.
4,Alex and I returned from our vacation last week.
4,I've been spending a lot of time thinking about the death of my cat.
4,back to the grind of the day to day work.
4,I've been suffering from low self esteem and for any fellow sufferers I'm sure you know how it can take it's toll on everything you do.
4,Alex just got home from a short trip to Walgreens to pick up some much needed sherbet.
4,In May 2000 Alex and were married in Las Vegas which is what made it an appealing stop off on our road trip.
4,it's been 11 days since I've updated ... alas I leave my blog behind too often.
4,Problem #3 on our road trip was another oversight on my part.
4,Alex and I had a little shin-dig for RM Friday night since he's leaving tomorrow for an internship in a land far far away for the summer.
4,I hardly ever write about my job here because there are so many tragic stories of people being fired for such things... and I like my job too much to take that chance.
4,4 years ago today Alex and I were married.
4,The worst thing about being sick is not remembering what it's like to be well.
4,I'm not sure what it is about TiVo but ever since I got it for my birthday I've been watching a lot less TV.
4,Last night Alex and I took the Matrix into the city with a backseat full of passengers.
4,Last Saturday Alex and I participated in the annual University Village yard sale.
4,Today I woke up with a vision of reading the paper while sipping my coffee and eating a nice breakfast.
4,I’m not sure if it’s just my luck or my taste in films but the movie on the flight home is never as good as the movie on the flight to my vacation location.
4,Reporting live from Cambridge participating in Jamie's yard sale.
4,Here I am in Boston... Cambridge to be exact.
4,check out these rad glasses that Alex brought home.
4,I try very diligently to keep up with pop culture.
4,The grocery store has a little sign above each express line which tells you how many items (or less) you may have.
4,Alex's brother came out to visit for the weekend.
4,My friend Greg is one great character.
4,This past Sunday I participated in my first ever Bay Area Night Games fondly referred to as BANG.
4,to which Alex replied 'That's a good idea.
4,as you leave today RM you must know you were in my dreams last night.
4,I can't believe we've been friends for 21 years.
4,Sometimes I watch TV when I'm feeling kind of blue.
4,and I'm not just saying it's crappy because I got four hours of sleep or because the coffee maker broke or because I have a MIR space station sized pimple on my chin making me look like a witch.
4,I guess I watch more reality TV than I ought to.
4,Sometimes Wednesday night is Ladies' Night with Julianne and Molly.
4,but the Bay Area just is not a fun place for the 4th of July.
4,my sandwich sucked so bad today that as I sat at the lunch table in the park surrounded by coworkers I couldn't help but give it the finger.
4,If I were to click my heels like Dorothy and repeat 'there's no place like home' I'm not sure if I would end up where I live now or where I go to visit my family.
4,Last week marked the one year anniversary of the last week of my old job.
0,Parents are back to choosing my friends again.

7,Well as a former dog officer I take these things seriously... Tonight after picking up my foster son for the weekend on the way home I nearly hit a dog the was running around all over the neighborhood and criss crossing a street where people drive quite fast.
7,My garbage man left me a nasty note today stating 'leave garbage out by 7:00 AM this is my 2nd trip by' I didn't realize my garbage was such a high priority What a life.
7,AFTERNOON 12 NOON TO 5:00 PM Additional Notes about Hiss reaction to being close to former pre-adoptive home: When I initially asked H why he wanted to take a specific path through the woods to see the pre-adopt.

7,hello I finally got here to comment on this blog - you're doing a great job zulu - hang in there I want to read a bit more and possibly chat with you before I write anything else - but I'll put your link on my blog too.
7,A strange day spent sitting in a hospital ward watching my youngest daughter sleep.
7,My son is home from boarding school for half term.
7,Nathalie Chica is a student from Los Angeles who like me has two blogs.
7,Sleep has muffled the last few days into nothingness.
7,I have to say a great big thank you to support at Blogger .
7,On the day she turned 13 sweet baby daughter was sneakily exchanged by aliens for the teenager from hell.
7,That line from a song by REM sticks in my mind.
7,The only thing I don't like about this blog (other than the fact that I'm not clever enough to skin it myself - design no problem - css etc is) is that there isn't a facility to put posts into catagories.
7,Yesterday I was seen by a different doctor than usual.
7,I feel like a fraud in doctors waiting rooms surrounded by coughs and colds small children with flushed faces and the elderly accompanied by carers with too loud over cheerful voices.
7,Glancing at the clock a few minutes ago I realised that yet another day had slipped from my grasp almost without notice.
7,My ex-husband and I have lived apart for at least 4 years so how come most days I get a phone call from one of my daughters saying 'Mum Where's Dad' Err hang on while I just consult my crystal ball...
7,I wonder why I use a pseudonym when writing both my poetry and my blog The more I think about it the less I can come up with a valid reason.
7,There are some blogs that you return to again and again not just to read the latest entry but to browse the archive of past musings.

0,Hey Well today has been a long day.
0,Hey people what's up I'm just sitting here waiting for summer vacation to start.
4,i give up nothing i can say or do will impact our relationship i feel like yelling from the highest peak please hear me please listen i notice my voice travels around his head without ever entering his ears i can repeat myself over and over two feet from him and he doesnt hear me he will see the tears in my eyes and never see that he caused them he will cause my heart to break and just step over the pieces he will sleep and play and never offer to lift a finger to help he will sit and stare at the television but only takes notice of me when i am naked i am nothing to him but a pair of tits and a pussy he doesnt know me doesnt see me doesnt hear me i see him i hear him i know him i want him to at least attempt to know me to hear the things on my mind to see the things that touch my heart i am nothing to him and he is everything to me i give up i cant reach him i give up i am done
4,how can i love him so much and hate him a tenth of a second later i want to strangle him and watch his eyes bug out and then i want to hold him and snuggle up close he infuriates me i feel the blood start to boil within i long to connect with him like we used to what happened to us three kids new job weight gain weight loss new friends old problems i want my life back how it used to be when he was there for me when his homecoming elicited a smile now we hide from each other in the same house we are roommates who fuck basically we just happen to be married and are parents to the same children the emptiness between us is vast communication is non-existent it hurts deep down in my soul i wait with bated breath to tell him things he cant hear me or doesnt want to what do i do i try and fail and try something else i am drowning in loneliness and grief do i love him hate him or even care
4,there is a place not far from here where the only walls are the ones within people where new beginnings take place and old friends are seen where the sound of laughing children echoes all around a place where strangers smile when you walk by and even if they are paid to be nice you don't care because it just feels good to be around happy people the air is cleaner you come home so tired yet refreshed as if god himself breathed new life into you you are free to be exactly who you are you don't have to expose your weaknesses but you are free to if you so desire you walk around and notice that this place is so inviting the butterflies seem to dance as they travel from each flower as if they know that this place is the only place they want to be the stars at night seem to shout your name bringing a sense of calm to your soul the moon in its brilliance beckons you to savor each second that you spend in this piece of heaven when you leave all you want to do is run back to the safety of innocence to the calling of truth to the friendly people who greet you with smiles on their faces and love in their hearts but that is not your reality for one week of the year you make the trek the rest of the time you are stuck here in oblivion away from that one place you'd rather be
0,Well the past few days have been very active for me yesterday I went too my nans house with my brothers girlfriend and did the gardening for them which was... interesting then we went home I sat on the computer then I was beckoned by my mum so I lay outside on the hammock and my uncle phoned so me and my dad went fishing with him.

0,Well life for me isn't that good my family is wicked yeah but its the people in my village that I hate there are people who are after me because they hit me and broke my nose Its just dumb All i'm doing is either skating playing guitar sitting on the pc or playing on my xbox I need too go outside I feel restricted as if there is a barrier outside my door I only feel good when i'm doing skarz i'm not sure why its just the feeling that I get as the adrenaline pumps through my blood when I do something outrageous it feels good i'm not sure how too explain the feeling its just like a rush a 'natural high' its the feeling you get when you land a trick for the first time on a skateboard or complete something you've been attempting too do for a while.
0,I got rid of wallpapers off of my site I felt that there was no significance for wallpapers nobody would download them anyway so I just felt that it was a waste of space.

7,Three Dot Three is next KDE release.
7,Ok I have this weird bug: when I select Kate - Save as I enter a file name and after the first character Kate freezes and I have to kill it.
7,I dreamt the black veil on the world will clear I dreamt our love is still there no more fear I dreamt all tears will for ever be drained I dreamt no more such a pain I dreamt life is not in vain I dreamt I would never woke up... 'Every time that I look into the mirror All these lines in my face getting clearer The past is gone It went by like dusk to dawn Isn't that the way Everybody's got their dues in life to pay'
7,Due to the freeze probably (we are getting restless) we (mainly uga and me) had a heated discussion on IRC about unser/auto+make.
7,yeah it is but not for me : for my daughters... Too bad the blog does not include pics I bet I would break blog-reading records.
7,See soccer Euro 2004 today's matches for a hint on the color ;) Seems like freeze is quite respected judging by the commits.
7,Hey It's freeze time this evening until the 27th That means we can actually watch soccer without feeling bad (a bit sad Italy did not go through) I'll try to fix some bugs and to make this KDevelop Get New Stuff work.
7,Foolishly I said I would implement KNewStuff in KDevelop.
7,Waoooh how thrilling First blog Now I am one of those stars that shine on Planet KDE :-) Time for a résumé 5 years ago I knew nothing of computers just got the Internet knew nothing of Linux or programming or partitions and filesystems.
7,After a week on holiday I'm back but as the kids will all be home for the next weeks I won't have much time for KDE.
7,Tomorrow I'm away for one week without internet connetion (will I survive) So maybe the beta 2 will be out by then.
7,Some people work quietly inside KDE and do a great job.
7,I went to my LUG meeting today.
7,Recently I came across 'Default' in several KDE applications.
7,The other day at the Linux meetup we talked about programming with a guy and he said 'in OOP if you use some 'if' or 'case' then your program is badly designed'.
7,No this does not refer to Qt4-preview1 Just a random track name... Second post of the day that'll reinforce the common saying that women are chatty...
7,Ok we're all hyped up on #kde-devel talking about Qt4 preview (except for the few people who affect to be 'blasés').
7,Hey do you know the New New Thing (TM) No it's not GMail (already one week old) it's called .node (dotnode) and is the new Orkut-like friends network.
7,I went to Montreal yesterday evening for the monthly Linux Meetup.
7,I finished the data translation for KVerbos so it can be used by English users.
7,I read Michael's blog and tried his litle new blogging tool.
7,So day after day we go closer to the real freeze.
7,We had an install fest at my LUG today.
7,It's nice to get HEAD open again.
7,These last days I was busy helping the kde fr team to try to do the maximum of translations.
7,I managed to finish the promised French translations (KTurtle and Kalzium) :-) I'm trying to help as much as possible by translating some kdeedu progs (starting with mine as they are easier) as the translating teams struggle to be ready for the DF (TM) (Deep Freeze).

7,After a day Of great accomplishments And yet of none A day of never leaving And not being worldly A day of not accomplishing anything of material value That will be of benefit To my material progression After a day such as this I look And with great wonder I regard The accomplishments Of revelations revealed Of friendships deepened And of some renewed Of bonds re-claimed And spirits lifted A day when I can see around me The souls I have touched And in so touching Have blessed And made happy The joy I have added The light I have shared And then I wish That every day Could be like this one.

0,my soul tells me i am dreaming and so my body agrees i feel that this is bliss in closed eyes and if consciousness will keep me from this moment then in eternal sleep i shall stay if to slumber forever is to pass on then to death i shall surrender... those lips and eyes possessed by an angel with the touch of feather and the breath of breeze with the warmth of spring the thrill of summer I fall for you my soul is pulled out of me to you as if it was all meant to be under the gloomy skies and chilling wind I long for you… A kiss will end this anxiety And start a new moment A kiss will suffice for this day’s desire One contact will let me die And fall to the deepest It shall drive to chaos with peace The kiss will be the first..

6,the day of departure and i find it unsetling as i jingle my key ring.
6,this is the day of departure and i was wide eyed at 5:15. an oddity for me.
6,well....after packing and repacking several times i think i have it.
6,Well my gauge before we take off says 7371 miles.
6,This was my final day of selling what I had left.
6,My mom gave me a book that is parents writing to their children.
6,My journey starts in less than 10 days and I got to spend some time with my daughter.
6,My parents have been informed 11 days prior to departure.
6,Decision has been made to split with my husband.
6,in portland maine right now at the library.
6,woke up this morning & someone asked me how long it took to get to maine &amp; it dawned on me that this is my 30th day on the road.
6,got in kind of late so didn't really talk to anybody.
6,this is where we viewed the top of the falls.
6,we had several views of full rainbows as we toured the falls on the boat.
6,can't say which is better both are spectacular.
6,as i crossed over into canada for the first time ever i got a glimpse of what a border guard looks like with no personality.
6,that much water - moving that fast can almost make you loose your cookies at times.
6,the last two nights have been particularly tough for me.
6,if i could fit a bumper sticker on the back of my bike it would read 'don't worry i don't always look this way.
6,'twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did.
6,just this morning i was journaling in my notebook the things that i would like about stopping & setting up house & the things i would miss about my road trip.
6,rush hour two days in a row.
6,tonight - going to niagra falls for the illumination tour.
6,1) just because it looks like a good road on the atlas doesn't mean necessarily that it is.
6,the whole reason i rode here is because people told me it was beautiful but when i pull in i'm too tired to explore &amp; just hit my tent thinking i will see it all tomorrow....soooo wrong as the rain ruined that idea
6,i thought i was doing pretty good picking out my camp site in fact i was darn proud of myself for taking a walk around the camp ground and finding the perfect spot where i could just ride my bike in and ride it out without trying to manouver it around to much....what i didn't really watch for was how close i was to the road.
6,riding through upper michigan....and run into my first fun (yeah right) road construction since i've been on my own.
6,i'm sure glad i had to stop for this road construction because the lady in the car in front hops out and runs back to me and tells me to put the helmet on - or i'm risking a $75 fine.
6,ironwood michigan is where i put my tent up for the night and so does martine.
6,through the state of wisconsin which by the way is state #8. my intended ride is hwy 2 to 13 and back to 2. i was glad i stopped at the tourist info center because she gave me another route because of road construction.
6,i know God made our bodies with all the senses we need to survive.
6,somebody said it is sweet clover.
6,ann marie has been a great inspiration over the last few days as she has been calling just to chat.
6,this is as far as i will take the north shore drive on this trip but someday i will be back because everybody i've talked to says i need to take this ride up into canada.
6,after exploring duluth a bit i take the scenic hiway up the north shore of lake superior.
6,seen and smelled a lot during my life but they always been squished somewhere on the road.
6,got my first glimpse ever of fire flies.
6,terry ann marie's friend....which forever be my friend now too has offered me a wonderful retreat at his cabin & 40 acres.
6,what a wonderful & much needed offer.
6,ever have one of those dreams that are just so real that you wake up in a cold sweat.
6,the campground i'm staying at i've been offered beer & pot.
6,my destination is duluth which is only 50 miles away....but i am very tired & still shaky from dumping my bike the day before.
6,ann marie & charlie will be amazed by this more than most of you because they actually saw my bike when i took off.
6,by the way when i pulled up to greg & linda's home on friday evening the 9th of july greg informs me that i just crossed over into minnesota.
6,after the kindness i've been shown the last several days i realize how selfish i've been in my own life & how important 'things' have been to me.
6,if there is one thing we rely on when traveling solo it is the kindness of strangers.
6,luckily i was pulling over to talk to a big strong biker that i had just met up the road.
6,seems everytime i drive around a big body of water i get lost....and you guessed it i always end up at junction 200. this let's me know i'm on the wrong road again.
6,this is a drive well worth it if you find yourself out this way.
6,as i leave minot i am driving about 5 mph under the speed limit.
6,raised in north dakota and some one asked me to paint a picture of the sun i would paint it hot pink.
6,rode only 20 miles & pulled over for gas & was seriously regretting packing up my tent.
6,camp parking lot is full of puddles.
6,...when you have 40 miles to go & the wind just blows & blows it seems like forever.
6,as i near culbertson montana wind gusts slow me down considerably.
6,turned 10k just outside glasgow montana.
6,yep getting a late start my first day.
6,getting thumbs up from the other bikers in town as they see this woman rider....loaded down and obviously traveling solo.
6,after riding so long i thought i would spend my first night at browning montana....until i rode into town and realized i felt like the only white woman in town.
6,i complained of charlie but i myself rode 348 miles the first day without stopping to eat.
6,rode about 100 miles with charlie before we say goodbye.
6,spent the night at wolf lodge coeur d' alene idaho.
6,wet on the windshield & wet on the glasses...for miles and miles.
6,charlie says we can slow down now but did we we put on some 230 miles up hiway coast 101. with the windy roads and rolling hills might as well been 400. someday i want to take some time and ride this coast.
6,met a girl hitch hiker today.
6,spent night near john day oregan.
6,not nearly as emotional as i thought i would be...but then charlie is still with me.
6,charlie and i have figured i can probably make it on $50 a day for gas meals and camping.
6,left before scheduled and traveled 12 hours.
6,it is gonna be hard leaving my cousins.
6,as i was in new jersey sitting in my hotel room i was watching the weather channel and found out i was headed right into tropical storm alex or so i thought.
6,it is so hard to keep up but north carolina is actually my 25th state i've ridden since i left wyoming.
6,well i've ridden 8000 miles since i've started my journey.
6,the only planned stop on the road of someone that i know.
6,i'm on my way to my cousins in north carolina and i know i need to make time to get there by her day off so everyone suggests the only easy way is to ride 1-95. so from new jersey to washington d.c. and almost to richmond virgina i ride the interstate.
6,well even after 30 days i find things i can live without.
6,my only knowledge of new jersey is what i learned from the turnpike.
6,after my iron butt run one more day at the hotel doesn't sound all that bad - so i splurge.
6,wow a bed never looked so good after riding for 25 hours straight.
6,wow i've never ridden through such heavy rain.
6,the visitor center was so helpful.
6,20 hours on the bike and guess what here comes the rain.
6,actually my night ride wasn't all that bad.
6,i got to say one thing for this city there bridges are spectacular.
6,have any of you ever driven in new york city they have got to get a prize for the worst roads ever.
6,well since i'm not sleeping tonight i figured nyc by night would be the perfect plan.
6,hey fellow readers i just made a change to my blog.
6,2 days after the democratic convention is over i ride through boston on a saturday afternoon.
6,never thought i would do that.
6,after trying desperately to find camping or lodging of any kind i'm wiped out.
6,ever hear of the iron butt run it is where bikers push themselves to ride 1000 miles in 24 hours.
6,portland maine right after my last blog...in fact in the library i met russel.
0,I sit and stair at the wall Watching the world spin round’ me Feeling your arms near by I close my eyes and begin to cry I don’t know how to say this Or even where to begin But today as you left the house I knew you would not be returning Trust me I tried to stop you I called out your name But the noise of the truck over took me And I saw the whole thing Your body lay dead on the drive way Your clothes were all torn I knew by the time I got out there That it was too late you were gone That driver was too stupid to look When he hit the side of your car He tried saying he was sorry But all that came out was a sob I know the pain was brief And that you died before you could suffer To which I am happy God took you quickly And I know you’re in a better place But why did you have to leave I didn’t even get to say goodbye Please come back to me I sit and stair at the wall Watching the world spin round’ me Feeling your arms near by I close my eyes and begin to cry

6,Great Chicago Tribune story on the factional divides in the Illinois GOP.
6,Steve is probably right that Keyes will run but I still think there is something fishy.
6,A Sun-Times columnist reports that Keyes has a half-million dollar debt still left over from his ill-fated previous electoral career.
6,As predicted yesterday there is now substantial evidence that Keyes is in fact running.
6,Marshall is a very smart guy but I think he somewhat misses the point.
6,As gleeful as we might be that someone with the proven inability to attract voters to support him is on the verge of the Republican party Senate nomination it is worth remembering that Keyes is no dummy.
6,I am henceforth betting one large bourbon (no ice) against Mr. Polysigh that Keyes will run.
6,'I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton's willingness to go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there.

6,Jack Pitney has agreed to come on as another member of our team.
6,Just got this comment: Here here Iowans are nice people.
6,Given that I am on this blog only at the sufferance of Mr. Polysigh I have to take exception to his rousing defense of Iowa against the coastal elites.
6,This comment just came in about the Keye's selection: BTW I am sure that somehow this is all the fault of the Chicago Cubs.
6,There's an interesting story in the Guardian today to the effect that Britain's third party the Liberal Democrats who have been making steady gains of late (largely on the back of their opposition to the Iraq war which both Labour government and the Tories supported) are moving in a substantially more libertarian direction--scaling back regulation introducing more competition into the welfare state coming out firmly against the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.
6,It now seems that the Illinois GOP has narrowed its choice for U.S. Senate candidate down to either Alan Keyes or Bush administration deputy drug czar Andrea Grubb Barthwell.
6,I think Phil and I have some difference here on the impact of the debates.
6,A couple of thoughts: The Kerry bounce/bump or lack thereof: I think a couple of things are going on here.
6,My eyes are glazed over having just spent an hour looking at the state-by-state polls.
6,A number of talking heads addressing the subject of Obama's remarkable (knock on wood) and sudden political success have put substantial weight on the fact that he is an African.
6,Following up on Steve's post about a possible Keye's v. Obama race I think this shows just how desperate Illinois Republicans have become.
6,This is truly beyond my capacity for satire.
6,To help get some more ideas going I've asked my friend Steve Teles to join me as a contributor to PolySigh.
6,As you can see I've posted a running tally of electoral votes based on the most recent state polls.

4,Have any of you seen the new MoveOn ad contest It's called Real People and they're going to try to get the winning ad aired during the RNC.

4,I've been working my fat ass off on the Seminars thingy and its dragging on due to the mathematical nature of the copy.
4,It wasn't too hard to find a title to tonights musings seeing as I hardly slept at all last night.
4,At the weekend I enjoyed a top night with my mate from school N. He's really impressed me with his adhesion to the new rules he's set himself with regards to his health and though I've helped in some small way to keep him on the straight and narrow its really his own steely determination thats changing him from a socially nervous fag-puffing boozer into the interesting chatty witty fit man-about-town that he is fast becoming.

7,I am normally up and running at the crack of dawn but the last week I have been struggling to sit up and drink my tea let alone race into action.
